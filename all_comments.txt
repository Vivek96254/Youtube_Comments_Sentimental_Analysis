You are a wonderful, very natural teacher. Thank you for the explanation.<br>I can&#39;t imagine how much better you have become in 6 years!
Please look up the difference between &quot;colon&quot; and &quot;semi-colon&quot;, because you have misnamed the poor thing so many times...

I thought json was a subset of JavaScript
Mate, good video but at several points you referred to colons as &quot;semicolons&quot;. Considering the severe importance of syntax in programming, I highly recommend leaving a pinned comment or attentive note in the description. Though I also understand this is a 6 year old video. So might not be worth the effort.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> you say :&quot;semicolon&quot; yet type colons. How did you let this through a coding demo?

@webdevsimplified is there a reason at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=398">6:38</a> you don&#39;t begin with the &quot;friends&quot; nest before adding the regular user Kyle? Or is that just to showcase the possibilities? <br><br>I guess I am curious if you could just begin with creating an array of &quot;friends&quot;, for example, and have Kyle listed beneath? <br>Or is there a reason to him leading the beginning?

Is JSON case-sensitive?

You start the video by referring to this punctuation mark ( : ) as a colon. We agree. At about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a>, you switch to semi-colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=301">5:01</a>, you switch back to colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=317">5:17</a>, you switch back to semi-colon. Can you confirm it&#39;s a colon?

Always loved the way C++ got transitioned to the web.  And don&#39;t forget the way Sun Microsystems nmacro became html.  When we built a web of documents across multiple servers, did we programmer grads know we&#39;d built something that could become the worldwide web, back in 1987, no, we just thought how great is this cool document linking all the other documents, and then we went for a drink in the pub.  But I will always be nostalgic about C.

My god. I&#39;m an experienced developer and I know everything about JSON, but I saw my man&#39;s video and I clickedüòÇ
wowow nice explain bro
This is a semicolon ;<br>This is a colon:<br>JSON uses both but they are not interchangeable. <br>Each has a specific syntactical use.<br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a>, starts getting them confused. Hope he edits this video, because it has some good information.

Good Explanation
Hey
HellO
So, I am a C++, and C# coder / game editor. When coming across an old hml site I wanted to link my discord server to the site as a side view and reformat it for my game/server that I host. In this moment I realized that even though I have been editing this site for some time now, I actually know next to nothing about the format its self or how it is layed out. Rather I have just been finding and changing the information already present. That being said I find this video very useful and my first step in the door to actually understanding hml and the benifets or switching to JSON. On that note for view back references i would really like to save these videos and i will definitely be subscribing. Thank you!

It would be good if you mentioned briefly an example on how you connect your JSON file to JS. In your tutorial you just copy paste the JSON text into your JS, but in a real situation, what / how do you work with this file? That&#39;s the only thing I still don&#39;t get... Thanks though, great content

Can you create demo on basically how to take data from SharePoint e.g  gym scheduler and have json read content and output to another program? - then also how does it get updates when source data changes? Data from SharePoint to Another program like brightSign‚Ä¶.

I&#39;m learning  Json in 10min
Great
Not to be rude, but You ended with the line &quot;you know know everything you need to use JSON in your future projects,&quot; but all we did was write JS. What&#39;s the actual POINT of JSON? How do we get JS to actually pull information directly from the json file and save new data to it??? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere and all I can find is &quot;explanations&quot; that don&#39;t explain anything. They just show us a couple limes of code and say &quot;there you go!&quot;, like what the actual f*k.<br><br>The video was very well done, format-wise, but content-wise I would really like to see more, please.<br><br>Sorry if im being rash, I&#39;m just getting really frustrated trying to figure out this dang language.
It should NOT take 10 minutes to learn JSON

I may sound stupid for this, but why would we need Json when we can just write the same code in javascript which we wrote in json, its like I am writing my notes in rough book only for me to write it again in my fair book later

What are the benefits of storing your arrays in a JSON file, if you still have to bring the contents of the file in as a string and then parse it? Serious question, I‚Äôm brand new. To me wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to create the arrays in the JSON file and link the variable to the file like you would your style sheet so your html isn‚Äôt all crazy?
Very Very Informative!!!

Very good explanation! Straightforward and simple! Thanks for creating such content! You are helping loads of people
JSON is a subset of JS not a superset <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=71">1:11</a>
I am not currently a programmer or a web developer. I did however, learn some basic stuff 20 some odd years ago when it was first coming out (zero experience with JSON). Your info was good and easy to understand, but the most important thing that&#39;s missing is this: why would I want to do anything like what you showed us? The only thing I saw you do was create a bunch of objects with key/value pairs, copy and paste your object into Javascript, and then show the value of the variables in the console. Seems like a a lot of work for almost zero functionality. Please give a real world use that would let me know what I could do with a structure like this and explain why I would need to write a JSON file if I&#39;m just going to copy and paste it into a script. Why not just type it in the script? Or if you have another tutorial that covers that, I&#39;m glad to check that out as well. Thanks
Hello World
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> - You say semicolon, but you are using a colon. Looks like colon is right though?
gg
i just wanna point out that while json is super useful in web development, it&#39;s not JUST for web development.<br>anytime you need to do inter-process communication, json is there for you, specially if your processes are made in different languages. you just deflate your object into a json string(there are plenty of libraries that do this for you, or you can just do it yourself.) and the receiving process inflates it back to an object it can use.<br><br>i dont like it much for configuration files......for that i think yaml is better. it&#39;s more human readable.<br>but for sharing objects between processes of different languages it&#39;s amazingly good.
REST API  is EZ?

Still don&#39;t get it. Why copy the data out of json file and paste into the HTML file? What&#39;s the point then of the json file? Can&#39;t you just point the json file? And if you have a json file how do you display all the info in it onto a HTML page?
Very well explained.

You did a great job and kept your promise.  I did learn JSON from your short video, I&#39;ve heard of it but wondered what it was - but now my curiosity has been satiated!  Unfortunately I&#39;m a C and Assembly language firmware engineer and can&#39;t see many use cases for it.  Typically I do sort of equivalent things by exchanging binary data, each end of the communications using the same data structure defined in a common header file that overlays the binary data to encode/decode it - very terse and very fast.  I&#39;m sure JSON packets could themselves be parsed by writing a C function to do so, but I don&#39;t know if anything web related is ever written in &quot;straight&quot; C (not C++ which isn&#39;t C) - if you know of any such cases please let me know with a reply. Thanks ! üòä
Don&#39;t believe this crap, you won&#39;t <i>learn</i> anything in 10 minutes. Besides, GPT4 will do the job anyway, and better than you.

colon : hehe not semi, just picking on you bro.<br>This is actually very useful to someone that is just wanting to dip their toes in JSON. Just don&#39;t do like he did at the end, lol. That doubles the load. You don&#39; tneed the entire thing. Parse it on output when needed. <br>But Very Good video man.

That was a good first look at json files but my negative is at the end you made the json file obselete by copy/pasting it&#39;s contents in to script tags.  <br>Would have been better to actually use the json file you created to pull out the name.

Reading the title of the video I was asking myself what is there to learn about json in such long 10 MINUTES!
ver good explanation
Kyle please help me with how to fetch data from Elasticsearch and Display it on React table. I have already designed it. But I get trouble in API calling
Standard English names:<br><b>{ and } are </b><b><i>braces</i></b> not <i>curly braces</i> =&gt; all <i>braces</i> are &quot;curly&quot; (Think of the British use of &quot;braces&quot; to mean [US/Canadian] &quot;men&#39;s suspenders&quot; and you&#39;ll see them.)<br><b>[ and ] are </b><b><i>brackets</i></b> not <i>square brackets</i> =&gt; all <i>brackets</i> are &quot;square&quot;<br><b>( and ) are </b><b><i>parentheses</i></b> (added here, just because the British get them wrong so often, calling any of these three sets a &quot;bracket&quot;)<br>Also, it would have been much better if you had used <b>standard ASCII quotation marks, instead of the word-processor &quot;smart quotes&quot;</b> (which you sometimes got wrong), because <b>JSON interpreters will NOT accept the &quot;curly&quot; versions of quotation marks as delimiting characters.</b>
I assume someone else has highlighted the error at time 4.29. &quot;...we would surround that name key in double quotes put a semicolon after it...&quot; No. Put a <b>**colon**</b> after it.  These small teaching errors can cause big debugging errors for learners later.  So far, except for this small detail, I really like the video.

I noticed that in your example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=315">5:15</a>, hobbies has a &quot;closing&quot; double quote up-front rather than an &quot;opening&quot; one like the previous items. Is this likely to cause an issue when running the code or is it just a font artefact that&#39;s ignored by the parsing software? Thanks.

Your screen is using smart quotes. This is invalid JSON. It is a common problem when a word processor (like Microsoft Word) is used instead of a code editor (like VS Code). Also, you called the separator character a semicolon, but it is a colon. You typed it correctly, but used the wrong term.<br><br>As this video is targeted to newbies, it is especially important to be accurate.

Two periods over each other is a colon ‚Äú:‚Äù.  A semicolon has a period and comma ‚Äú;‚Äù.  JSON key/value pairs are separated by colons (like in the video), but you kept saying semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù.

In real life, where do json objects come from ?
const JSON = require(&#39;../../json.json&#39;)<br><br>[{<br>  &quot;YouTube Video Analysis&quot;: {<br>    &quot;Rating&quot;: 9,<br>    &quot;Reasoning&quot;: &quot;Whilst many should know this before getting to JSON creation/formatting, you created the JSON file but didn&#39;t actually <b>use</b> the JSON file. You copied the file&#39;s content into your HTML document, and only showed parsing a string to a json. Neglecting importing/requiring the JSON.&quot;, <br>    &quot;wouldRecommendVideo&quot;: true<br>  }, <br>}]<br><br>console.log(`${JSON[&quot;Youtube Video Analysis&quot;].rating} out of 10`) <br>// 9 out of 10<br><br>‚ù§Ô∏è Keep up the good work.
can someone explains me, why creating a json file and then copy its contents by hand to the script tag is in anyway useful...
great! thank you
I&#39;m learning how to write c# code at the moment and I had one task, where I had to work with a .json file. My god I tried to get my code to work for HOURS before I realized it was indeed a .json file and thought of checking how they work and how to use them. I now feel really really dumb :D. But thanks a lot for this great explanation of how they work!!!!

But you did not call the JSON file in the script? you literally coded it hard <br>How useful is creating the JSON file then and how do you read it in the code?

I love this video, thanks for that.<br>You listed advantages to using it and did a great demo. <br>But why would anyone actually create a json file? If you&#39;re creating a different file eg: the JS one that you created, what&#39;s the purpose of having a separate .json file? Why not just have everything in the JS one? Why have two?

Just an observation: Does it help to keep reinventing the wheel many times over. As soon as you have learnt Java, html, python, script, you are already behind the curve. I think it is not productive to keep coming up with newer tools and languages. Stick with the old tried and true. Thanks but no thanks.

Great video, and super simple. I am confused @WebDevSimplified why you copied over the contents of the JSON file. I understand the point that was made that it is just javascript and then to prove that point you copied it, but then the .json file seemingly appeared useless after that point was made and the video ended. It seems you proved the utility of JSON and then disproved the utility immediately at the end. I am just hoping for some clarification from you or anyone else in the comments. I am currently trying to take Javascript objects and write them in JSON to avoid build steps and that task is complicated to me, so I am trying to break it down to smaller problem domains.

This video promised to cover everything we need to know about JSON. It doesn&#39;t, instead it shows you rattling off code without explanation of form and function and at the end you have a half hearted application, based on your local server which has no bearing on anything in the real world.

Can we use Jason to store information like a simple database?
If I a make a JSON file to create a comic book or model API, is it a copywrite violations to scan covers and images for an image property?
I&#39;ve been picking things up here and there as I go but this is one of the best tutorials I&#39;ve seen. You did a great job of not focusing on the mistakes people commonly make (which just perpetuates those mistakes to future learners).

Very Useful , make some complex Structure Example
Bit of a necro here but perhaps someone will see it and be able to explain for me: What is the point of the JSON Object file? I know video is more than 3 years old so maybe the tech changed but I can skip the JSON.parse() method entirely and just access and print properties of the pasted objects as you would any other javascript object. I don&#39;t have to emulate a string and then parse. Did something change or are there advantages I am missing? <br><br>I know I still hear JSON mentioned a lot so I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m missing something obvious or key. Thanks to anyone who sees this and can offer feedback/guidance. &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: I just read about the advantage of JSON files for transmitting data and now see that they are more like a database file with specific formatting than a functional block of code. <br><br>So I can see why you&#39;d use them, but I&#39;m still confused as to why I can access and manipulate the object members without using JSON.parse(). Thanks again.

When converting the JSON into a string we use backticks instead of double or single quotes because you can only use backticks to create a multiline string.

Kid you should be a model in your spare time.

Generally JSON is regarded as a hands-down better alternative over XML when there is no demand for things like XSL-based operations (or their logical equivalents employing different tech).  Now, truth be told, I am rusty on the whole XML bit, especially on the namespacing stuff, but it&#39;s my understanding that while JSON would nest oblects, XML would use referencing to point to other objects listed in the stream (perhaps to be received later) which, demands a more stream-oriented approach (processing an object before it&#39;s fully populated with external references), instead of going depth-first as in the example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=375">6:15</a>.  I understand that one COULD use the same approach in JSON, but the key difference is that XML leaves you no choice, and it&#39;s a good thing, imo.  Then there&#39;s a schema validation thing and XPath for data selection...  Am I missing something?  And if not, it would be nice if you could maybe give examples as to what scenarios would make XML preferable.  Thank you.

Hi, great video, wat about using an app like Postman to validate json response by drilling down objects and object attributes? A big bunch of people struggle to do just dat and it seems like the perfect tutorial for you to make. Just my 2ct. Good job on the channel!

Thank you for this great video. Love how you show examples and your explanation is easy to follow and understand.  A friend sent me this video as I‚Äôm new to json.  Very grateful.
extremely helpful
So JSON is simply for storing data in a way that other languages can read?
I may missed the point, but if its in a seperate file, why copy it to the js file?
great

Awesome video, per usual. One question I had was what is the purpose of JSON? I realize in the video you reference its lightweight and easy to send back and forth because of its small file size, but I still am curious about JSON&#39;s main purpose. In my bootcamp many of our repos have a package.JSON with dependencies, scripts, etc.. Are these in a JSON file because they are easier to send back and forth or is there some other reason? What am I missing?
why do you blink so much
thank you
Great video
that was an incredibly concise and helpful video

Thank you so much<br>Very informative.
I&#39;m not a programmer.<br>I&#39;m watching this video because I recently deleted my youtube channel but I wanted to save my playlists somehow, so I downloaded some files with the IDs of the videos I had in them.<br>Back in 2019, there was a fast trick to create a playlist by searching the IDs of several videos separated by commas, but it seems to no longer work.<br>I asked what to do and someone replied &quot;All you need is YouTube API&quot; but didn&#39;t explain shit. I&#39;m having a headache, but this video is so clear that I understood most of it, thanks a lot!

Hello, One question about JSON..<br>1) How do i add next line in json? (In html we use &lt;br/&gt; or we can use &lt;p&gt;) but how do i use next line in JSON? <br>I have tried using a) \n b)\\n c)\n\n but none of them works

How to make the dynamic value as the key in nested JSON
Can you go over how you get yo hair like that
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to do an advanced JSON video, but I never really know the right way to import JSON files into my code. I know the readfile syntax is different in different languages, and even between Node.js vs. client-side js. It would be cool to see a walk through on best practices for that.
Thank you for your clear &amp; stunning explanation ! I‚Äôve found dozens info of json , but not until I took your lesson then I finally realize what json is ! Appreciate!
Great lesson.  Sorry I&#39;ll have to watch again because I fell asleep halfway.  Not your fault, I just walked 18 holes and well, I guess the fresh air did me good.
I still wonder what is secret to that hair style ü§î,
json has global variables that can be assigned to other properties and how?
the speed is just right
Nice hair.
This is a very good tutorial. It also increases the font size.
Very less information
Its was really useful, indeed, everything I needed to get my instance of a problem out of the ground!
I&#39;m a beginner making a game in Godot, i was trying to make an inventory system using a tutorial when the tutorial started using .json files, i was slightly scared i&#39;d have to learn another programming language, but thankfully this doesn&#39;t seem to complex, thanks

Hi Sir, how do I obtain a table that auto-populate. Meaning row could be added automatically.
Very useful since im new to JSON thank u web dev simplified for making this video
It would be more clear if you can add an example explaining how JSON acts as a translator between two programs or services;
i think this is the best video i saw that explains JSON.<br>great job<br>btw, i think that for very very simple data structures, an .INI file is even easier and simpler (but not widely spread, and not for the web, REST etc&#39;)
Hi, May I know what software you used to create the video for explaining the process of creating a JSON Object. And Great Tutorial Mate, Thanks for Sharing with us.
Hey Really great video thank you so much. You did an amazing job.
Very fine clear and straigthfull explanation.
Great
Nice bro , it&#39;s interesting 1,2 M viewed. :))
I&#39;m not even working in web development. I just watched this for fun. Very good explanation! Straightforward and simple! Thanks for creating such content! You are helping loads of people!
The good thing about you is, you have very good ability to explain everything in detail ,with a really good flow ,to understand well
Thank you so much.. Such a simple explanation.. Amazing

Please fix your quotes, this is confusing for beginners that don&#39;t get it to work. The proper quote is the &quot; not the one word is using. With quote open/close
What softwares is he using
But have you heard of JSTAN (JavaScript Tabular Array Notation)?<br><br>Regular repeating JSON Array with space-wasting redundant field names:<br>[<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 1, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;One&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 2, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Two&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 3, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Three&quot;}<br>]<br><br>The equivalent more compact JSTAN &quot;table&quot;:<br>[<br> [&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;],<br> [1, &quot;One&quot;],<br> [2, &quot;Two&quot;],<br> [3, &quot;Three&quot;]<br>]<br><br>JSTAN is still valid JSON, just a more compact way of storing data from an array of non-hierarchical objects of the same type. You might call it a JSON <del>design pattern</del> storage pattern.
I think I understand, but what is the output. Can you give an example?
its 12 minutes
Thank you very much
Just the Video that I was looking Short &amp; Sweet
Me and my team are making a game with this!<br>Yes, a game! We learned the basics of JSON, i think we can do it! :D
I am new to coding and still confused after watching this video. It is still unclear to me what the difference between JS and JSON is (other than some syntax rules). in other words: what can JSON do that JS can&#39;t? I mean, the small syntax differences don&#39;t look relevant enough for me to care enough about JSON. Anyone has an answer? Thanks in advance.
Thanks for this, still struggling how to make an object dictionary iterable but this helped me learn the basics
while(true){<br>System.out.print(&quot;thanks&quot;);<br>}

I really appreciate this video. Thank you.
Great work! this video just made it so simple...all clear.
You kind of went to fast, bro&#39;.  But got it.
very good bro

i have seen a lot of coding videos on youtube and they all say that i used to work at google and then i retired and started this, it is good to see that there is someone who is being truthful and simple yet having every bit of knowledge as they have and more .
Excelent. Thanks
Thank you
Your cute!!!
Is it compulsory for JSON to be wrapper aorund {}
I dont understand, why do you create the json file but then just copy and paste the content inside the same html file. Whats the point of the json file then and how do you call and show its information?
how to use nested json
At the end of all that, you still didn&#39;t explain why there is a need for JSON files if you are going to duplicate the same exact data in your JavaScript.  It would make more sense if you showed the Javascript pointing to the JSON file for the data.
Disclaimer: Don&#39;t use dates or undefined in JSON. Also, comments are not supported in JSON (please save us, we need information about our properties!).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> colon*
there are people who simply have that something when it comes to teaching others, your ability to explain it to an idiot in 10 something minutes is a gem, do you have a course or something?
JSON is just fancy array
Gracias
you look constatnly suprised (gud video tho)
Thank you for this.

He didn&#39;t even teach how to read data into a json file.
Great, short and to the point
Very nice
Wikipedia says that JSON is designed as a non-strict subset of JavaScript. Not the other way around -JSON superset of JS-.

Really helpful üòä
I dare you guys to take a shot every time he blinks.
Hello. Can I know how to add third company in the example you gave in the json file using python?
Great stuff, as usual. But please go a little slower. For those of us typing along it&#39;s sometimes hard to keep up. I imagine it&#39;s not necessary to copy and paste your JSON file into the HTML file, so a tutorial on including or embedding it would be helpful. Maybe you have one, I&#39;ll have to search.
u blink too much that i started blinking consciously
Just amazing dude
You&#39;re good Kyle
Nice
Nice !  Simple and helpful
Thanks buddy! That was helpful!<br>:)
If i convert an array into a string like JSON.stringify(array) what will be its time complexity. Is it o(n) or o(1).Thanks in advance!!

couldn‚Äôt you just do <br><b>const companies = require(‚Äú./companies.json‚Äù)</b><br>instead of pasting the entire json script? What was the point of the json file if you‚Äôre not gonna use it?
npw do this for YAML :P
Love from Bangladesh
Your video is awesome. Adding to that you&#39;re freakin handsome ;)
Excellent video
What if I want to modify any values in JSON file/object, how do I do that?
Awesome
Not blinking is an illusion. And so is death XDXDXD
What&#39;s the point of the json file if you&#39;re just going to copy it&#39;s contents into the html file?  Would of been much more useful to end the video showing how that json file is used in a real world example.
Do you have a website?
This is the way all video tutorials should be.  Content is good.  Not only that, you explain things thoroughly, and enunciate very clearly.  And, in addition, you use a readable font size and contrast, so that I can read the code from across a room.  I&#39;m going to have to see what other videos you have.  I can only hope that you put out a lot more tutorial videos.
Thanks very clean up code.
My compliments to you! I&#39;m just following a course including JSON in the office but it is NOT as clear as you are! I thank you so much for your great job  in explaining so clearly such a concept.

On screen, you showed a colon ( : ), but when describing it, you were saying semicolon ( ; )... just for clarification for those that may be listening, but not looking at the code.

How to store image in an object in .json file and display it through JSX
ÏûòÎ¥§ÏäµÎãàÎã§.<br><br>good video
I believe another way of wrapping a JSON object is with curly brackets ({ }) instead of square brackets ([ ]) but they seem to work the same way regardless.
thx

Awesome video pal.  Very easy to understand and digest.
Very useful! Just to the point. I hate the long stories about meaningless background about other stuff. Thanks man, really appreciate this type of videos. 5/5, and I&#39;ll come back for more stuff.<br>Take care!

Thank You.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> you called a colon a semi-colon. (edit) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> as well.  Giving me colon semi-colon confusion.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=318">5:18</a> as well.   (colon = : )  (semi-colon = ; )
Hi I was wondering why it showed this:<br><br>index.html:8 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token { in JSON at position 142<br>    at JSON.parse (&lt;anonymous&gt;)<br>    at index.html:23
Excellent!

Easiest explanation of JSON on youtube
Crisp and Clear. Thank you
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=370">6:10</a>, if Kyle is Joey&#39;s friend, wouldn&#39;t it be repeated infinitely?<br><br>Kyle&#39;s friends value would include the Joey object, which would include the Kyle object, which would include the Joey object, and so on.
So wait- is a JSON file essentially a string literal?
Why do we need double quotes in JSON
I&#39;m just reviewing it again! I&#39;m starting to really understand it.
dude, you have a talent for teaching like no other. Not your first video I&#39;ve seen and not last. Great content
Very well done tutorial: super clear and to the point! Thumbs up to you!
Hello Kyle~ can you make a video about dependent dropdown list in javascript and json? :)
&#39;&#39;comment&#39;&#39; : &#39;&#39;thank you for teaching me!&#39;&#39;
Kyle you are {&quot;TheKingOfCode&quot;,} or even &quot;Kode&quot; never before have I seen or heard such a clear and concise explanation of code of any kind, you got the gift. America is starving for talented teachers. You have just made a programmer out of me and that&#39;s not artificial intelligence, but a quantum leap for me after all these years. Thank you for sharing Kyle; &quot;King of Code&quot; or Kode.
I just wanted to learn this to make a Minecraft Java mod addon....
It is truly impressive that he didn&#39;t blink once in the video!
Very useful and to the point.  Thanks
You&#39;ve improved a lot since then, congrats
Why would you copy and paste the contents of the .json file to your .html file? Why create a .json file then? Isn&#39;t there a way to reference/import the .json information?
Thank you so much for this. The last part of the video was slightly confusing and I couldn‚Äôt see where you were clicking too. Please do another video just fully breaking down that last part. Also, when you were explaining the first part you used different brackets and on the second part you started off with the square brackets why is that?
Really great idea to tailor with JSON... reminds me a lot like .NET with Delegates (Patternization techniques with attributes that hold values). Thank you for showing!
you&#39;re a handsome programmer : )
doing this for mc
Thank you for the amazingly simple, yet thorough, explanation of JSON. I&#39;ve always wanted to learn it and you made it so simple. I&#39;ve always fine through my code of the current project I&#39;m working on to add JSON and it&#39;s amazing :)
This was so succinct, thank you
I learned something!
Excellent,Thanks. Request you to show how you record YouTube Videos.
I‚Äôm Json, so it‚Äôs you guys how‚Äôs been fucking about with me!
Somebody please explain to Kyle what a (semi)colon is!
Great tutorial
your blinking makes it a bit hard to focus
All hail to the Jason
So, if I understand correctly, classes in JSON can be compared to dicts in Python?
Very nice explanation subs
Can&#39;t you just call the index.html file using a function embedded in the Html file?<br>thanks again for the demonstration üëç
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=360">6:00</a> shouldn&#39;t `friends`&#39;s value be just an object? An array is redundant since the value is a single object.<br><br>Edit: JSON is a subset of JS not a superset<br><br>Edit2: how do you send JSON? How do you convert an object to JSON? How do you practically use it (get/post requests)? So much necessary information left out...

call me a bird bc imma nest so much with this knowledge
It was a very good and helpful video, but why should I create a .json file when I copy it over the my script anyways?
But why is json used? Did I miss something..

Why did he copy json data to HTML file while json file already had data?<br><br>Cannot access the data from .json file?
{<br><br>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,<br>&quot;age&quot; : 102,<br>&quot;address&quot;: &quot;DC&quot;,<br>&quot;subject&quot;:&quot;Json is easy and can be changed to list with loop in js &quot;,<br>&quot;continueMakingVideo&quot;: true<br><br>}

Can we connect the JSON file with the JS file instead of copy and pasting??
Including JSON.stringify would be more perfect. But the content is high quality üëçüëçüëçüòä
Very compact and succinct. (Y)
JSON is great way to transfer data specially while implementing APIs. Sometimes when you print JSON in logs, you see an unformatted string. I have found <a href="https://jsontoolbox.com/">https://jsontoolbox.com</a> to be a great way to format multiple such JSON on the same page.
thank you

If we can do the same in Javascript then why we use JSON?
very nice explanation
Is JSON files some sort of DATA flat-file that is then access by JavaScript or some other application?
God damn json syntax is unintuitive and hard to read, are you kidding me. That friend array of users camouflages into pure ass, how are you supposed to keep track of where you are with that many lines of strings.<br> <br>It&#39;s a lot easier to grasp the separation of a new variable/object when the variable type has to be declared at the start, in other languages.
Thank you very much
This was great. In SEO,  we use JSON LD for Schema markup! This helped a lot!
If you just copy / pasted the info in the end, what was the point of the json file? Couldn&#39;t you have just keyed it into the html page to begin with? I&#39;m confused.
Excellent explantaion, thanks :)
why didn&#39;t you explained how to import data from the json file to js program?
you just made my day, you gave me a great idea how to solve my problem by creating an array of objects. thanks man
can I use json as a small database? and what are the advantages and disadvantages?
Thanks man, I will follow you videos for sure!!!
Overall, this video is very well done, but you mixed up the words colon : and semicolon ;.

I think the video was very good. I started JavaScript 1 month ago. I know some basics and with that video I catch the logic very fast. Continue the good work my friend
Please make a video on API‚Äôs how they work between front end and back end. Where does the Json , XML files used during API integration<br>Thanks in advance
the only helpful thing ive found on json files thank you sm
Thanks dude
Nice just learn what i needed
For me, it&#39;s better to put your JavaScript file below the body on the html. Because it&#39;s a different code  when you write it on javascript. And i&#39;m having a little bit of confusion. But other than that, I&#39;ve learned all of your videos &#39;til now.
one of the most confusing videos, i have seen ever
Great presentation. Thank you.
Thank you üëèüëè
why is this important why couldent you just make an object in js to begin with?
Was greatly insightful :&#39;)
Great video! I have one quibble though: you said &quot;semicolon&quot; instead of &quot;colon&quot; a couple of times. Just thought I&#39;d point this out as it may confuse some people.
i dont see the index.html

So nice to get that at the first go of learning
Is there any standardization for json response?
very well said, thanks for the tutorial. question, hm do you have or are you going to create a tutorial on how to use JSON in sending and receiving data to and from an API. cheers
This video should be in Top 10 Anime Betrayals bc it titled learn JSON in 10 minute, but is 12 minute? long? Author explain. am v confusion

What if the value is a function
this is great for me, I&#39;m not a developer but you explained it perfectly.
Thanks for creating this informative and easy to follow tutorial.  I am new to JSON.  Can you please tell me what program you are using to write this code in?
Why is it necessary to convert the JSON to a string within the HTML?
Thanks man.
I noticed in the example u gave that the objects were closed in a boxed bracket but I thought a json code is encompassed in a curvy bracket. Please can you elaborate?  Thank you

Why is the key value enclosed in quotes?  What information is added that simply interpreting anything to the left of a colon as a key.  The quotes just seem to be unnecessary extra typing.

Hi, is there any chance you could help me with some basic JSON for Sharepoint conditional formating?
You keep saying semicolon when you mean colon. (Semi colon ;  colon : ). It‚Äôs very important for correct syntax.

Your videos are easy to understand
simply simple, thanks!!!
I perfectly agree with @Marsh Wetland: Perfect pacing and explanation! Thank you! Just one question: what&#39;s the difference between console.log(companies) and console.log(JSON.parse(companies))? Didn&#39;t you say that JS understands JSON by itself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=570">9:30</a>), so why parsing?
Excellent presentation. Thanks for sharing

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> that&#39;s a colon.
I prefer JSON over YAML. JSON is easier to read!
This is the best video I have came across till now on JSON. Thanks mate.
For the first time I actually understand what is JSON is .. thank you üòä. Can you please do some tutorials on Creating API&#39;s to download data from web??
is it possible to get key by passing a value in JSON <br><br>for Eg:<br>{ &quot;id&quot; : [ {&quot;1&quot;:&quot;abcd&quot;},<br>             {&quot;2&quot;:&quot;efgh&quot;} ] }<br><br>enter &quot;abcd&quot;<br>and get 1 as output
Around 4.40 you kept saying semi-colon instead of colon; other than that which was confusing, it was a very good instroduction to JSON
Hi Kyle, Thank you for the time spent making this video only to share it for free.<br><br>I want to make a clarification - first I am a beginner developer. Do we have any significant difference between json created for use in a JS program with those created to be used with other programming languages (In my own case, python)?<br><br>Here is an example of my iteration:<br><br>{<br>&quot;name&quot;: [&quot;Emmanuel&quot;], <br>&quot;age&quot;: [23],<br>&quot;gender&quot;: [&quot;male&#39;]<br>}<br>Will this work if I call it using say JS?

Excellent video thank you. I have a very basic question: why write the CEO of Small Business null instead of an empty string? Is there any advantage to having null?
awesome
Very Useful
Short yet on point. Thanks man.
Why did u say JSON is lightweight, I made a comparison to CSV, JSON is like 3 times more of the file size of CSV.
Help helpful. Kindly consider making a short video on API
thx so much!
thanks man

in JSON first need start from { } and only then you can use array []

Hi, I just found your videos and I like them a lot! <br>I&#39;m having trouble moving JSON data (that I receive from an API) from my server to a separate JS file (on the frontend) where I have functions set-up to process it and display the parts I want in my HTML. I thought this project would be a fairly simple Express App, but I&#39;m totally lost right now. I watched your middleware video, so I&#39;ll tinker some more and see what I can figure out...<br>Thanks for making videos!!
Thank you for video. Very helpful üëçüèª
wouldn&#39;t you want your html document to use the actual .json file instead of embedding the same code you could have simply written into your javascript.  In short, shouldn&#39;t you have shown us how to embed the .json file or am I missing something?
Am I the only one who couldn&#39;t get over the inverted opening double-quotes in &quot;hobbies&quot;? Other than that, a very informative video - great content!
Thank you bro, that really helped a lot.
Hi Kyle, thank you for the video! Liked and subscribed!<br>I hope you could help me out, I have a PHP file with JSON in it and it&#39;s working well.<br>But the JSON code is a mess so when I try to make it prettier using some tools to add new data to it, it loses functionality.<br>Befoire: var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{&quot;square&quot;:{&quot;silver&quot;:{&quot;100x100&quot;:{&quot;squareFull&quot;:{&quot;PRODUCT&quot;:&quot;261&quot;,&quot;SKU&quot;:1732, THIS IS WORKING<br>After:     var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{<br>  &quot;square&quot;: {<br>    &quot;silver&quot;: {<br>      &quot;100x100&quot;: {<br>        &quot;squareFull&quot;: {<br>          &quot;PRODUCT&quot;: &quot;261&quot;,<br>          &quot;SKU&quot;: 1732,<br>          &quot;PRICE&quot;: 60.45,<br>          &quot;OLD_PRICE&quot;: &quot;65.00&quot;,<br>          &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;/catalog/zerkalnaya_plitka/zerkalnaya_plitka_kvadrat/serebryanaya_kvadratnaya_zerkalnaya_plitka/?oid=1732&quot;<br>        } This is not working
Great tutorial! But what I was missing: what about dates (and timestamps)?
I know I&#39;m a bit late but instead of copying the json into the js, how would you simply make a variable with the content of the json file? As a dummy example that wouldn&#39;t actually work: let variable = file(name.json).content
Very useful video, thanks!

I need to convert the json file into dataframe using python or r.
How to read this type of dataset in python?. Because i have the same type of dataset having object dictionary and list all those things.
Why build the file if all you are going to do is cut and paste it?<br>Isn&#39;t there some sort of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include">#include</a>?<br><br>Why put it in quotes when all you are going to do is parse it?

Thank you for the information, its useful
This was a fantastic explanation, thank you so much!
thank you!
Good but it‚Äôs a Colin : not a semicolon ;
How do you read a JSON file from another HTML file, as you did in the video, but without copying and pasting the code? something like export/import?
Please correct me if I am wrong, but to leave notes in your script, use &lt;/item&gt;?
Simply thank you very much

If you forget those double quotes for keys, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.
super
Maybe I just missed the point. Why didn‚Äôt you just type all the json code in JS at first place but instead of a separate json file then copy from it? The json file should be imported, right?
Thank u for explaining so well
wow, is very simple to understand what you explain and know how to work with JSON.
So you copied the whole json file to that html file, so what&#39;s the purpose to create a json file when you can write all of that in the html file?
&quot;And in the next course, we&#39;ll talk about the difference between colon &amp; semi-colon ...&quot;
What‚Äôs the point of json?
I don&#39;t get it... Why would you type code in a json file just to copy/paste it?  How do you access the code that&#39;s on the json file?
An error occurred =&gt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
Who is Jason?
i cant emulate my code some help please?
No,I learned JSON at 12 minute
I like your JSON  Video, one of the best.
Thanks for making this understandable.
I had a couple questions, instead of copying and pasting the code from the JSON file, are you able to just call the other file that you had already created? If you can&#39;t call the initial JSON file you had created, why even create the file? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to just code in the html file from beginning?
Can I get your mail please? üòä
Very clear and informative, Thanks!!
thanx
this isnt 10minutes this is 11 minutes
Nice! Thanks so much!!
Great video. I think this is the best tutorial I have seen about JSON. Thank you very much.
Excellent video. Congratulations!,
Could you please do a tutorial on password resets with the passwords declared in JSON file(I now know how to do that from this vid) but linked to JS file and how to call it on the html :) <br>also, with my html my on click or oj-on-action does not want to work but i have done so much research and still struggling<br>Thank you, any help will be greatly appreciated
Just keep it up bro....It was really json in 10 mins.. Thanks
Super Simple and Fast Explanation
I have a simple question . when you are copying all the data from json file into the main html portion (script) then what is the use of creating Json file at all???????????. you should demonstrate to link the json file and then use the data inside of it using javascript . Ans me anyone
It was very good videos in a very easy way. I&#39;m also a teacher but I have good very good grip on PHP. Want to work on python too so Can u make a video on python with web development?? Without using any framework like flask Or something. Just like PHP. We write our script file without any special software and for e.g. anaconda üêç. Your response will be appreciable for me. Thank you.
Very nice üëç
Your explanation is so good
Watch at 2x and learn JSON in 6 minutes üòÇ
Explaining JSON in 10 minutes &quot;simplified&quot; is even more elongated than it takes to explain it in depth and formally at a university xd. Also calling JSON as a &quot;superset of Javascript&quot; is simply a fale statement, lol.
Actually, they&#39;re not semi-colons. They are colons - two dots. Semi-colons have dot and comma.
You lied it&#39;s 12 minutes not 10
Indeed this is Web Dev Simplified. Keep up the good work.
Very well explained.  To the point, and just what I needed :)
I want to like this video twice
So what about data?
json.parse i just parsed this comment
I cant thank you enough for making these quick guides man. Ure an hero!
Nice video! Well explained the concept
You keep referrening : as semicolon or double colon. It&#39;s just colon.
Very clearly explained, I am grateful for your tutorials, thanks mate!
Thank you, brother. <br>From Bangladesh üáßüá©
Hey, is there away to assign a file to an &quot;input&quot; like a &quot;word or excel&quot; in html and then read the contents  from js? The thing is,  i want the file to automatically be select and when i press a button it reads the info.
very good video.
So can I put down on my Resume that I know JSON now?
Great. Super easy to understand! Thanks you.
java script please
Cover AVRO format pls
Dude, you keep saying semi-colon. A semi-colon is a ;   you mean colon, which is :

Thank you sir
I just saw my first video about JSON and don&#39;t get the big-deal of it. If it is just to store data, I could store it in any form (txt file, in a database, etc). What&#39;s the point of JSON? Where is its power?

GREAT video
nice video. helpful.
I thought JSON was like a new programming language but just an installment of JavaScript like React and jQuery.<br><br>Also what is the purpose of JSON.stringify?
Very nice. Do we need to convert json to base 64 string before sending over the internet?
I guess this is also good to learn for minecraft commands?
Thanks. This video was very useful to me. It helps me understand the nic concept of JSON.
thank you very much this was so helpfull  , &lt;3
Awesome tutorial. Thank you sir!
Please edit audio wherever you have said semicolon but meant a colon.
Áõõ‰∏ñÁæéÈ¢úÔºÅ
Niice one
; semi colon<br>: colon<br><br>Good video though!
great video thanks for the simple explanation really helps break it down nice and simple, quick question can different objects have different number of properties, like in your companies example let&#39;s say big cooperation has name, numOfEmployees, ceo, rating but second element in array json object small start up has 6 properties lets say numOfBranches and something else?
<b>Visible_happiness.json</b>
Thanks man..
What avout two way relations? For example friends.‚Äã A friend with B.‚Äã The JSON of A has an array of all of his friends. Contained is of course the JSON of B. But the JSON of B also has an array with all of his friends. Contained is the JSON of A and so. How does this work?
You handsome
It&#39;s a colon, not a semicolon

am i the only one that realized that he blinked for the first time in an intro?
hey web dev simplified would you mind answering one of my silly questions related to python? please let me know thanks!
: is a colon and not semi colon..
Thank you, that was super interesting
So in simple words JSON is like classes and objects of C++
sir blinks alot.

Excellent
why is he so cute
Nice Job!!! Just started learning JSON. Glad I find this video first.
Loved this video! Do you have a video covering what a beginner should use to write JSON? Also, how to apply it to real life applications?
anything in JSON is valid JS.. so what`s the point of JSON.parse when you already had access to that JSON before that? (i guess that`s just an example to show both ways ?) . I`m assuming you use JSON.parse only when you make an api request and get your JSON as a string and not as an array.  Please correct me if I`m wrong
Hi Kyle
Thank you!
Excellent tutorial! Clear content and quick presentation. Good job.
not semi-colon between k-v pairs.  full colon.
The way of the presentation of the contents in each of your videos is really good. Thank you for these great tutorials. I have a request if possible- do you have the plan to make some videos related to programming. For example, Algorithm and Data Structures etc. and how they can be practically used in Web Development (if needed).<br>Thanks again. :)
Hi bro, hope you doing great!<br>I really don&#39;t have much idea about Json, but you gave me what I am looking for, thank you so much your clear and easy to catch about Json, keep it up bro<br>Thanks again!<br>Anthony
I really enjoyed this quick start JSON tutorial. You are very clear and provided enough info that i can write my own. Thank you
I just understand 20% when you talk because i&#39;m my english not well , but I focus this video i can more understand about Json, Thank you so much.
Have been following now am becoming an expert in JS... Thanks buddy I need your contact.
you mean colon not semicolon
Great video, thank you!
love your video very very sensible thanks keep up on this
Great video for a starter like me, i wanted to see how you can call a json data file within the executable script to be read as an input file (not copy/pasting the whole content), how easy is that?
Simple and crisp information, Thanx bud
Learn JSON in 12 minutes lol. Great vid!
My questions (I am new to programming):<br><br>1. Consider those values in JSON need to get from database, what can we write in order to loop all the data from database before putting into html to be used?<br><br>2. Then, how do we link the JSON file to html without have to copy all the things in JSON to script first like you did in the video? (Can we put a variable in html and let JSON return to them?)
Can we add conditional statement within JSON data?
Awesome, thanks!
&quot;That was awesome ! ! ! thanks&quot;
Simple and good video
Thanks for the video. Your introduction to the JSON topic was paced and complete. It really helped get me started. Nice work.
With my most recent exposure to programming/code of any kind having been an intro to C, this feels like dark witchery. Code that doesn&#39;t care what type your inputs are - wow, imagine that.
Wow. Nicely explained. Thank you so much! üëçüèº
You did a wonderful job Kyle of giving a clear, succinct and thorough explanation of JSON.<br>I will definitely be coming back for more tutorials from you.
Great explaination man üôå

Damn, dude, are you a model or something?
I think JavaScript is superset of JSON
Outstanding video.  My only comment is to let you know that the &quot;:&quot; is a colon, not a semicolon.  The semicolon contains a comma as in &quot;;&quot;.  Best regards. :-)
What kind of keyboard do you use? It sounds so good.
Excelent tutorial. Right to the point, clear and perfect speed to follow and understand what you are doing. Subscribed!
Wow, thank you! It was so hard  to understand how json and parsing works. I have been looking at guides that were too confusing!
Subscribed after one minute of your video. Thanks alot for great content üëçüëç
good
how you do the live refresh? I mean you save it and the console refreshes directly.
Great tutorial ! Thanks for sharing
Quality content, mate, thanks for this one.<br>I&#39;m at a new job dealing with APIs, and your content is just what I was looking for to understand JSON better.<br>Liked and subscribed, keep up the good work.
Excellent tutorial
This is an incredible video! I feel better now that I have an understanding of JSON and all this in just 12 minutes. If others were to teach me, Half-Life 3 Episode 4 would have been released, and I still wouldn&#39;t have gotten a thing.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=590">9:50</a> you added the apostrophe &#39; , and made it in to string. How you do that? Is that somehow possible in the PhpStorm?
JSON is my street name.
Apologies if this is stupid question, but why do we need the JSON file if we just paste its contents into the HTML? Is there another way to get the JSON data without pasting?
Could u plz show how make selection click in html page and select json file and load json data and display json data in HTML page in format table.
Thanks man, cleared up some things very nicely, very informative
Thanks you&#39;re a life saver.
I&#39;m new at this but at the end, wouldn&#39;t it be:  ((companies)[0].name)    instead of (companies)[0].name)    (I added an extra paren at the beginning) or is it actually the way you stated?
Rather than surrounding the JSON by ` backticks , can we not give the user the object value of the JSON as he will still have an option to JSON.stringify it. And most of the times, the user may require the object of JSON instead of the string
Hey thank you for the video.  I want to be an exceptional programmer and these are very helpful videos to learn different coding languages. Much appreciated.
Thank you so much sir! I am in the process of becoming Azure certified and i really wanted to iron-clad my understanding of ARM templates which are written in JSON format. This video was a wonderful explanantion of the creation and syntax used in such files. Thanks alot bro!
hi,i have a question ,what is diffence:<br> [{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}] <br>and<br> {&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}
God bless you bro !..
In the example user.json for hobbies is the double quotation correct?(both closing double quote)<br>And the array element for &quot;hobbies&quot; i.e. &quot;weight lifting&quot; have you used the correct
Informative !
So basically the JSON objects are dictionaries.
Hmm, You do realise there are occasions where you say &#39;semicolon&#39; when in fact you mean &#39;colon&#39;?   I started noticing it in the 4th minute.
just a quick question <br>why did you use [ ] first ???<br>I thought we use { } to open and close
It supports bouillon? What about consomm√©?

Start to finish, coding a rest API from Corvid
How do you import the json file in the JS file instead of copy pasting the entire json code? Not sure I followed that part
Thanks
Sorry if I missed something, but whats the point in this double thing you did?<br>I removed the backticks and also I removed the JSON.parse and  inner parenthesis and it works just fine.<br>Any reason they must be added? Thanks for gr8 video!
Hi folks, maybe this is a stupid question but when we insert JSON inside of an HTML document do we have to copy all JSON lines of code inside of HTML or there is a shorter way to work on it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=325">5:25</a> why you wrote &quot;Hobbies&quot; with same double quotes both sides ... is that a mistake by you???
could you pls make a video about &quot;implicit grant flow&quot; and how to implement it?
So what was the json file for? Didn&#39;t look like you needed it at all. You just put everything you wrote in the json file in the script tag. This doesn&#39;t really show or explain what json is even for. You didn&#39;t even use the json file for anything. I am very confused.
He&#39;s too pretty for me to focus on the topic....
One thing that I‚Äôd change about JSON... allow trailing commas in lists.  So many times I‚Äôve forgotten to sort out the commas when adding/removing/swapping lines in JSON files, and then spent time wondering why my code‚Äôs not working.  And, I‚Äôm not keen on all those quotes either... seriously, why do key names need to be quoted?
great video, thanks!
{<br>&quot;good&quot;: &quot;yes&quot;<br>}
That&#39;s 10 minutes in base 12...
It&#39;s a colon, not a semi colon.
Is this doable with Python aswell?
Cool My Friend
What compiler or ide is this?
You really cleared up all the confusion I had, thanks man üôèüôè
Brilliant!! Your work is impeccable. So easy hands on to JSON for dummies. Good :)
What is the best tool freely available to for Json and python?
Great video and Thank you!
Which text editor are u using¬°?
Can you share what syntax highlighting/coloring scheme you&#39;re using? Maybe the font too? Thanks!

Hey can you create a javascript program that is able to save, search, view, update and delete a data to and from a database table and should use JSON object or Javascript object in passing and receiving data???
Hey bro how do I make it so that VS code underlines my mistakes (if I make any)? Thank you.
Thanks Mate. it was really helpful to me in understanding JSON basics
Really good tutorial, only 1 minor thing. <br>In the end you say you can do anything with the newly passed JSON object that you can do with a normal javascript object.<br>There is no &quot;JSON Object&quot;. The JSON has been parsed from a String to an Object so calling it a JSON Object is incorrect, it&#39;s just an Object :)
it helped
HOW AMAZING !! I Love it excellent explanation <br>Thanks so much
Noob question: please explain in detail how to make output go to console as in the video.  Great explanation of json. I just had trouble following along in vs code cause console did not show results
this is my code if you see Logan&#39;s user like this comment<br><br><br>{<br> &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Joseph&quot;,<br> &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: true,<br><br> &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br><br> &quot;VisiviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;Team Leader/Programmer&quot;,<br> &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;: [{<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Logan&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;Modeler&quot;<br>  },<br>  {<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Jake&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;Animator&quot;<br>  },<br>  {<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Kali&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;PlayTester&quot;<br>  },<br>  {<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Alayna&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;PlayTester&quot;<br>  },<br>  {<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Caleb&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;Designer&quot;<br>  },<br>  {<br>   &quot;user&quot;: &quot;Jordyn&quot;,<br>   &quot;Programmingperson&quot;: false,<br>   &quot;team&quot;: &quot;Visivi Studios&quot;,<br>   &quot;VisviStudiosTeamRole&quot;: &quot;Creator&quot;<br>  }<br> ]<br>}

Why would you build a companies.json file just to copy/paste its content into your index.html file? Why not let the &#39;companies&#39; variable in index.html equal the companies.json file (or &quot;JSON.stringify(companies.json)&quot; assuming that&#39;s indeed a real method)?

This was super helpful and clear, thank you so much!
Very nice and informative. Thanks
Thanks !!!
Really simple and straight forward - much appreciated
Thanks so much. Happy Coding :)
Thanks, just the information I needed to get started on a project using JSON data
I feel was feeling a bit intimidated by JSON, but you explained it really well and it makes much more sense now. Thanks!
Great little video! Nice job üòÄ

Your explanation was as cool as your look! <br>Hats Off Bro!
The simplicity of the explanation is mind blowing. Great video üëç
How you made the animations text?
Thanks for this. But I have a question. Wouldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t we call the json file rather than copying what&#39;s in the file in our html? seems redundant to have a file... Or am I missing something?

Love this ,Simple and effective.....I am so observed  that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=340">5:40</a> a confused quote at &quot;hobbies&quot;...just a thing üòú
Thanks for the video, but it&#39;s not a &quot;semi-colon&quot;.
Nice tutorial, but how do you let a variable equal to a JSON file content without manually copying and pasting?
Smooth Explanation....Now i know how to use JSON as a tester ..5 star for you
Thank you
Beautiful Way of explaining, So easy to follow and understand, and matters are spot on instantly. Kindly do more a systematic tutorial for Kotlin too. Thank you
You are great dude, this is the first video of your&#39;s I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m Subscribed!
wait a second. Why did you create a .JSON file if you just pasted the entire file into your html file? lol what was the point of having the .JSON file?
If you haven&#39;t already, please do an in-depth video on using Axios.get/put/post/patch/ etc . I&#39;m simply lost when it comes to referring to the DOM and trying to update the page using a database. :(
I cannot tell you how much I truly appreciate how you break everything down into bite-sized pieces of information! I felt such a wave of relief after watching this video. Seriously.
[&quot;Appreciation Level&#39;:, &quot;True&quot;;, &quot;Thanks, a lot&#39;} ]

Besides confusing a colon with a semicolon this was an excellent tutorial. Thanks for sharing
Thanks for helping me hack pvz2 lmao
Thanks!
Thanks for the great tutorial!! Quick question - how do you write JavaScript code to read the data in the JSON file and store that info in a variable? :D
I don&#39;t know any programming. YouTube randomly recommended it. But I feel I learned something. Thank you.
Thank you.for clarifying this subject. I honestly feel as if I can understand how to use Json now. I do have a question. How do I rename a txt file to json so that roku will read it for direct publishing?
A tutorial on JSON? I find it odd but great video nevertheless.
can you make a video about consuming API with Fetch. please.
i can&#39;t than you enough .<br>you man is amazing.<br>you are my go to guy when i try to learn something complicated.<br>even though i am 2 min into the video<br>but i know i will understand in the end.<br>after the Promise video.<br>i trust you <br>thanks a lot &lt;3.
Awesome lecture!!

wow...thanks bro.... :)
If you&#39;re familiar with python JSON is a list of dictionaries, more commonly known as a hash map. One of the most efficient data structures that&#39;s used commonly to make fast code.
Thank you!
This is really a great video ‚ù§<br>Thanks a lot man ‚ù§

wow.....
Thanks for the video. Trying to learn json and coffeescript before moving on to action cable for my rails development üòä
U copy pasted JSON DATA INTO JS but you didn&#39;t show how use json directly from file.Json
You are calling colon a semicolon?
Absolutely to the point !!!
watch in 1.25x speed. thank me later
Hi, Could you please share a video where we can create a JSON file using JavaScript and place at given path?
Thanks for being noob friendly LOL the best way to learn things is simply taking it from the beginning üåºüåºüåº /eva
Bad tutorial
very helpful. Thanks mate
I can&#39;t thank you enough. I was stuck with understanding both the idea and syntax with JSON until now. Thank you.
Quite informative!   PS: That&#39;s colon in the JSON not semicolon ... just a feedback. thaks
Thanks this helped, title is not click bait.
You start with saying that Json is stored in a separate Json file but then you copy it to a JavaScript file with no explanation on why you did this. I was thinking you were going to access the json file directly.
You have no idea how you&#39;ve helped. Thank you!<br>Subscribed.
It&#39;s beautifully presented.
Thanks very much!  Very helpful!
So clear and easy to follow. Thank you!
Thanks Mate! Love from India!!
A really great vid, except the &quot;all you need to know&quot; comment at the end which isn&#39;t correct. Anyway, thank you, a very useful pace and style. Please get a Patreon account.
What about with the other languages?
This is by far, the best!!
nobody:<br>Kyle: &quot;I like lifting weights.&quot;
great video. tks
Sorry not a pro here I&#39;m just starting out in programming, but could you please elaborate more on the uses of JSON ? I don&#39;t see why is it so significant the fact that it can be realized with OOP concept in most languages. Also, isn&#39;t it more efficient to store data in a database and manipulate them with SQL ? Thanks in advanced.
Thank you Sir
Solved One Of the  biggest doubt between json and objects. Thank you :-)
Ir kyle is joeys friend... wouldnt it end up in an infinite nesting issue?
Isn&#39;t it colon after Key? You&#39;ve been saying semi-colon. Its confusing!
Why is he keep blinking?
Is there a way to NOT copy and paste the entire json code into the script tag?
Instead of null, we should consider using a null value representation such as  -1 or even -1000,  some value that will display safely. So as to reduce headache for users who consume the json data!
This is really simpler than most JSON explanation I could find on the internet. You&#39;re doing great. Keep it up, bro!
Can you please do a video of &quot;How to integrate SQL code with JSON in 10 minutes&quot;? thx
I think I&#39;ve seen you before. I just can&#39;t remember where . . .
Awesome one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=565">9:25</a> how do i check that out in my browser
to the point and clear thank you! please keep these videos coming!
How do you read the json array from the file to achieve the same result without manually copying the information from &quot;user.json&quot; to the &quot;index.html&quot; file?
One tip: Don&#39;t start object keys names with number ;-)
Good One
If you want to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string that can be passed to a server then use let variableName = JSON.stringify(yourObject);
Your tutorials are world class but are you doing some sort of code with your blinking?
Keep making these awesome videos
Right ... Learn in 10 and forget in 7. We have to stop this tree of domination! Let&#39;s meet at 9 I&#39;ll give instructions for everybody. We&#39;ll swing the boat and fly away at speeds of 1 and 2. I&#39;ve noticed one thing... If I get paid well - I never forget things.
Good video. However. JSON is a subset of javascript not a superset. Also even to that there are exceptions. <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset">http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset</a>
Thank you.
Enjoyed it. Thanks
Your explanation is so clear and rightly paced. Thanks!
it&#39;s possible for 5 minutes or less if you make it for those who know javascript already. but for beginners, this 10 minutes wouldn&#39;t be enough. As I have known js for a long time, this is simplest explanation for json but a little too long.
Hi.Iam from India <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tq">#Tq</a>

Simply awesome man , thank you !!
[{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}]
angularjs videos definitely would be great in your playlist.<br><br>btw nicely explained
Wow. Good articulation with nice voice.
wow, it&#39;s like shortest clip of complete tutorial
you are not using semi-colons but colons!
if the whole JSON text is copied in the script what is the need of JSON file and how to use it in script
Good tutorial, I understand all in one go. well explained in such a simple way.  Thanks
Just a perfect tutorial. Exactly how it should be done. Subscribed!
Great. Hey, I&#39;m stuck with parsing a nested json file in my python program. How to parse a nested json file?
Molto interessante!
good information.  tq
&quot;SUCH&quot; a great tutorial. Many thanks
Great JSON video! By the way, which font are you using in the video?
your videos are so helpful. God Bless u dude. can u make a video on how to use json, js,  and html to  pull data from  the json and put it  in the html webpage in a textbox or show how to pull information from a webpage  user  inputing text into a textbox into the json file.
You cleared all dark corners about JSON but when you started about Javascript and JSON man I lost the stream like a power failure. :( <br><br>But that&#39;s ok. I only wanted the JSON part. :)
You speak with just the right speed and clarity! BeautifulÔºÅ
Thank you for this tutorial ... Really great
i&#39;m literally just here cuz i want to create Minecraft bedrock mods because a new modding update is coming out and need to learn the basics lol.
you said &#39;semi-colon&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> ... is that a mistake or a &#39;semi-colon&#39; works as well as &#39;colon&#39;?
Hey are you the guy from coralfish12g?? Coz you both look identical
I still don&#39;t understand you literally just created a JS object, so what is JSON and why would you use it?
talk about simplicity... couldn&#39;t be more simplified
And yeah. You&#39;re beautiful
Thank You Sir.<br>I fully understand it.<br>Thanks again.
Perfect pacing and explanation. I just wonder at the diversity or randomness of your double quote marks, e.g. at time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=348">5:48</a>. I guess it&#39;s just an artifact of your font, but it really threw me.
I think you said that backwards: wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to say JS is a superset of JSON? And logically, only a subset would seem to guarantee compatiblity, a superset would by definition have things they subset doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just being pedantic, I guess.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,  you sir have achieved that. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thumbsup">#thumbsUp</a>
Thanks, man.  You know, I&#39;ve been studying web dev between working my 2 jobs, and after hearing people mention JSON more times than I can count, only found out what it was for about a week ago.  Appreciate you providing this brief explanation.
Well done !...Thank you for taking the time to produce such informative and to the point presentations. You have a new subscriber !
You keep calling &quot;colon&quot; a &quot;semi-colon&quot;
Really easy to understand and well-explained video. Much more helpful than reading old university slides, haha.
Does it work the same way in vs code for c++?
it&#39;s impressive how you the ideas were one by one and smooth to grasp, however on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=160">2:40</a> the type you call objects, isn&#39;t it a map? Since in java it&#39;s called like that!
So backticks instead of stringify???
Good Explanation
Quick &amp; professional explanation - exactly what I needed. Subscribed!
&quot;comment&quot; : &quot;That was awesome ! ! ! thanks&quot;
Very informative, brief and end-to-the-point. Many thanks :)
Excellent! Thanks a lot!
Loved the video and want to suggest <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/">https://jsonformatter.org</a> for all in one JSON tool to format and validate JSON data.

so basically just an array of objects?
very useful video
I&#39;d like to connect to u on LinkedIn :)
I expected to learn how to write a JSONpath of a JSON field.
That&#39;s not semicolon. It&#39;s just colon.
[{<br>&quot;useful&quot;:  &quot;thanks&quot;<br>}, ]
Thank You Sir...You have simply explained the very simple thing
Absolutely Fantastic!! Keep up the good work <a href="http://bro.love/">Bro.Love</a> from India

I am neither a programmer or developer, but have been hacked by one! PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME!! I have a hard time describing what&#39;s goin on to other people who don&#39;t understand this type of thing, so basically they think I&#39;m crazy..I&#39;m so sorry for asking for your help! I know that you have more important things in life to worry about, but this is almost to the point of destroying mine :(
throwback to the old windows. Great video!
Thanks a lot. That was just a great and pleasant tutorial.
Very good explanation... clear and objective !  Great job.
Excellent!! Subscribed
thank you that was perfect!<br>pls do short explaining like this on git&amp;github
clear, clean and sharp!!!... very useful video!!!...
Would love if you made a Tutorial on jQuery!
Great video, really helpful
I always thought that a JSON file had to begin with curly brackets, but I see you using regular brackets in the demo. What&#39;s the rule here for the start of a JSON file?
Really well done and organised üëçü§ì
That was such a professionally styled tutorial video! You got full control over what you&#39;re gonna go through and you present with simple examples! It has not been often I&#39;ve seen performance like this on a channel of this size. You deserve to be much bigger, and I hope many more people will get to see this and benefit from it! Keep it up!
I hope you all enjoyed this quick video on JSON. If you have any topics you want me to cover in future videos let me know!

I thought json was a subset of JavaScript
Mate, good video but at several points you referred to colons as &quot;semicolons&quot;. Considering the severe importance of syntax in programming, I highly recommend leaving a pinned comment or attentive note in the description. Though I also understand this is a 6 year old video. So might not be worth the effort.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> you say :&quot;semicolon&quot; yet type colons. How did you let this through a coding demo?

@webdevsimplified is there a reason at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=398">6:38</a> you don&#39;t begin with the &quot;friends&quot; nest before adding the regular user Kyle? Or is that just to showcase the possibilities? <br><br>I guess I am curious if you could just begin with creating an array of &quot;friends&quot;, for example, and have Kyle listed beneath? <br>Or is there a reason to him leading the beginning?

You start the video by referring to this punctuation mark ( : ) as a colon. We agree. At about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a>, you switch to semi-colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=301">5:01</a>, you switch back to colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=317">5:17</a>, you switch back to semi-colon. Can you confirm it&#39;s a colon?

Always loved the way C++ got transitioned to the web.  And don&#39;t forget the way Sun Microsystems nmacro became html.  When we built a web of documents across multiple servers, did we programmer grads know we&#39;d built something that could become the worldwide web, back in 1987, no, we just thought how great is this cool document linking all the other documents, and then we went for a drink in the pub.  But I will always be nostalgic about C.

My god. I&#39;m an experienced developer and I know everything about JSON, but I saw my man&#39;s video and I clickedüòÇ
wowow nice explain bro
This is a semicolon ;<br>This is a colon:<br>JSON uses both but they are not interchangeable. <br>Each has a specific syntactical use.<br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a>, starts getting them confused. Hope he edits this video, because it has some good information.

Good Explanation
Hey
HellO
So, I am a C++, and C# coder / game editor. When coming across an old hml site I wanted to link my discord server to the site as a side view and reformat it for my game/server that I host. In this moment I realized that even though I have been editing this site for some time now, I actually know next to nothing about the format its self or how it is layed out. Rather I have just been finding and changing the information already present. That being said I find this video very useful and my first step in the door to actually understanding hml and the benifets or switching to JSON. On that note for view back references i would really like to save these videos and i will definitely be subscribing. Thank you!

It would be good if you mentioned briefly an example on how you connect your JSON file to JS. In your tutorial you just copy paste the JSON text into your JS, but in a real situation, what / how do you work with this file? That&#39;s the only thing I still don&#39;t get... Thanks though, great content

Can you create demo on basically how to take data from SharePoint e.g  gym scheduler and have json read content and output to another program? - then also how does it get updates when source data changes? Data from SharePoint to Another program like brightSign‚Ä¶.

I&#39;m learning  Json in 10min
Great
Not to be rude, but You ended with the line &quot;you know know everything you need to use JSON in your future projects,&quot; but all we did was write JS. What&#39;s the actual POINT of JSON? How do we get JS to actually pull information directly from the json file and save new data to it??? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere and all I can find is &quot;explanations&quot; that don&#39;t explain anything. They just show us a couple limes of code and say &quot;there you go!&quot;, like what the actual f*k.<br><br>The video was very well done, format-wise, but content-wise I would really like to see more, please.<br><br>Sorry if im being rash, I&#39;m just getting really frustrated trying to figure out this dang language.
It should NOT take 10 minutes to learn JSON

What are the benefits of storing your arrays in a JSON file, if you still have to bring the contents of the file in as a string and then parse it? Serious question, I‚Äôm brand new. To me wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to create the arrays in the JSON file and link the variable to the file like you would your style sheet so your html isn‚Äôt all crazy?
Very Very Informative!!!

Very good explanation! Straightforward and simple! Thanks for creating such content! You are helping loads of people
JSON is a subset of JS not a superset <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=71">1:11</a>
I am not currently a programmer or a web developer. I did however, learn some basic stuff 20 some odd years ago when it was first coming out (zero experience with JSON). Your info was good and easy to understand, but the most important thing that&#39;s missing is this: why would I want to do anything like what you showed us? The only thing I saw you do was create a bunch of objects with key/value pairs, copy and paste your object into Javascript, and then show the value of the variables in the console. Seems like a a lot of work for almost zero functionality. Please give a real world use that would let me know what I could do with a structure like this and explain why I would need to write a JSON file if I&#39;m just going to copy and paste it into a script. Why not just type it in the script? Or if you have another tutorial that covers that, I&#39;m glad to check that out as well. Thanks
Hello World
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> - You say semicolon, but you are using a colon. Looks like colon is right though?
gg
i just wanna point out that while json is super useful in web development, it&#39;s not JUST for web development.<br>anytime you need to do inter-process communication, json is there for you, specially if your processes are made in different languages. you just deflate your object into a json string(there are plenty of libraries that do this for you, or you can just do it yourself.) and the receiving process inflates it back to an object it can use.<br><br>i dont like it much for configuration files......for that i think yaml is better. it&#39;s more human readable.<br>but for sharing objects between processes of different languages it&#39;s amazingly good.
REST API  is EZ?

Still don&#39;t get it. Why copy the data out of json file and paste into the HTML file? What&#39;s the point then of the json file? Can&#39;t you just point the json file? And if you have a json file how do you display all the info in it onto a HTML page?
Very well explained.

Isn&#39;t storing keys as strings very inefficient as strings use a lot of memory (at least one byte per character) and are slow to check for equality to another string? Is there a way to use integers as json keys instead, like a C-array being indexed via integers?

You did a great job and kept your promise.  I did learn JSON from your short video, I&#39;ve heard of it but wondered what it was - but now my curiosity has been satiated!  Unfortunately I&#39;m a C and Assembly language firmware engineer and can&#39;t see many use cases for it.  Typically I do sort of equivalent things by exchanging binary data, each end of the communications using the same data structure defined in a common header file that overlays the binary data to encode/decode it - very terse and very fast.  I&#39;m sure JSON packets could themselves be parsed by writing a C function to do so, but I don&#39;t know if anything web related is ever written in &quot;straight&quot; C (not C++ which isn&#39;t C) - if you know of any such cases please let me know with a reply. Thanks ! üòä
Don&#39;t believe this crap, you won&#39;t <i>learn</i> anything in 10 minutes. Besides, GPT4 will do the job anyway, and better than you.

Thank you for this great video! You  explained json in very simple language and covered a lot of content.
Definitely thought some dude named Jason developed this format, disappointed.
colon : hehe not semi, just picking on you bro.<br>This is actually very useful to someone that is just wanting to dip their toes in JSON. Just don&#39;t do like he did at the end, lol. That doubles the load. You don&#39; tneed the entire thing. Parse it on output when needed. <br>But Very Good video man.

That was a good first look at json files but my negative is at the end you made the json file obselete by copy/pasting it&#39;s contents in to script tags.  <br>Would have been better to actually use the json file you created to pull out the name.

Reading the title of the video I was asking myself what is there to learn about json in such long 10 MINUTES!
ver good explanation
Kyle please help me with how to fetch data from Elasticsearch and Display it on React table. I have already designed it. But I get trouble in API calling
Standard English names:<br><b>{ and } are </b><b><i>braces</i></b> not <i>curly braces</i> =&gt; all <i>braces</i> are &quot;curly&quot; (Think of the British use of &quot;braces&quot; to mean [US/Canadian] &quot;men&#39;s suspenders&quot; and you&#39;ll see them.)<br><b>[ and ] are </b><b><i>brackets</i></b> not <i>square brackets</i> =&gt; all <i>brackets</i> are &quot;square&quot;<br><b>( and ) are </b><b><i>parentheses</i></b> (added here, just because the British get them wrong so often, calling any of these three sets a &quot;bracket&quot;)<br>Also, it would have been much better if you had used <b>standard ASCII quotation marks, instead of the word-processor &quot;smart quotes&quot;</b> (which you sometimes got wrong), because <b>JSON interpreters will NOT accept the &quot;curly&quot; versions of quotation marks as delimiting characters.</b>
I assume someone else has highlighted the error at time 4.29. &quot;...we would surround that name key in double quotes put a semicolon after it...&quot; No. Put a <b>**colon**</b> after it.  These small teaching errors can cause big debugging errors for learners later.  So far, except for this small detail, I really like the video.

I noticed that in your example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=315">5:15</a>, hobbies has a &quot;closing&quot; double quote up-front rather than an &quot;opening&quot; one like the previous items. Is this likely to cause an issue when running the code or is it just a font artefact that&#39;s ignored by the parsing software? Thanks.

Your screen is using smart quotes. This is invalid JSON. It is a common problem when a word processor (like Microsoft Word) is used instead of a code editor (like VS Code). Also, you called the separator character a semicolon, but it is a colon. You typed it correctly, but used the wrong term.<br><br>As this video is targeted to newbies, it is especially important to be accurate.

Two periods over each other is a colon ‚Äú:‚Äù.  A semicolon has a period and comma ‚Äú;‚Äù.  JSON key/value pairs are separated by colons (like in the video), but you kept saying semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù.

Hi, Thank you for the Json short courses you really made easy to understand, Do you have courses on udemy, if yes how can I access them, under which name is it?
Very good explanation in the shorter time, thanks much!!!

In real life, where do json objects come from ?
const JSON = require(&#39;../../json.json&#39;)<br><br>[{<br>  &quot;YouTube Video Analysis&quot;: {<br>    &quot;Rating&quot;: 9,<br>    &quot;Reasoning&quot;: &quot;Whilst many should know this before getting to JSON creation/formatting, you created the JSON file but didn&#39;t actually <b>use</b> the JSON file. You copied the file&#39;s content into your HTML document, and only showed parsing a string to a json. Neglecting importing/requiring the JSON.&quot;, <br>    &quot;wouldRecommendVideo&quot;: true<br>  }, <br>}]<br><br>console.log(`${JSON[&quot;Youtube Video Analysis&quot;].rating} out of 10`) <br>// 9 out of 10<br><br>‚ù§Ô∏è Keep up the good work.
can someone explains me, why creating a json file and then copy its contents by hand to the script tag is in anyway useful...
great! thank you
I&#39;m learning how to write c# code at the moment and I had one task, where I had to work with a .json file. My god I tried to get my code to work for HOURS before I realized it was indeed a .json file and thought of checking how they work and how to use them. I now feel really really dumb :D. But thanks a lot for this great explanation of how they work!!!!

Nice explanation.
But you did not call the JSON file in the script? you literally coded it hard <br>How useful is creating the JSON file then and how do you read it in the code?

So what the use of it you can creat objects and arrys in js too and u did not even used json file u just copy pasted contents of it to html file im confiused

I love this video, thanks for that.<br>You listed advantages to using it and did a great demo. <br>But why would anyone actually create a json file? If you&#39;re creating a different file eg: the JS one that you created, what&#39;s the purpose of having a separate .json file? Why not just have everything in the JS one? Why have two?

Just an observation: Does it help to keep reinventing the wheel many times over. As soon as you have learnt Java, html, python, script, you are already behind the curve. I think it is not productive to keep coming up with newer tools and languages. Stick with the old tried and true. Thanks but no thanks.

Great video, and super simple. I am confused @WebDevSimplified why you copied over the contents of the JSON file. I understand the point that was made that it is just javascript and then to prove that point you copied it, but then the .json file seemingly appeared useless after that point was made and the video ended. It seems you proved the utility of JSON and then disproved the utility immediately at the end. I am just hoping for some clarification from you or anyone else in the comments. I am currently trying to take Javascript objects and write them in JSON to avoid build steps and that task is complicated to me, so I am trying to break it down to smaller problem domains.

This video promised to cover everything we need to know about JSON. It doesn&#39;t, instead it shows you rattling off code without explanation of form and function and at the end you have a half hearted application, based on your local server which has no bearing on anything in the real world.

I&#39;ve been making apps and fetching data from APIs but it was never clear to me what JSON really is, this video helped a lot. Thank you!
excellent presentation.  One mistake, you kept saying &quot;semi-colon&quot; when in fact it should be &quot;colon&quot;.

If I a make a JSON file to create a comic book or model API, is it a copywrite violations to scan covers and images for an image property?
I&#39;ve been picking things up here and there as I go but this is one of the best tutorials I&#39;ve seen. You did a great job of not focusing on the mistakes people commonly make (which just perpetuates those mistakes to future learners).

Very Useful , make some complex Structure Example
Bit of a necro here but perhaps someone will see it and be able to explain for me: What is the point of the JSON Object file? I know video is more than 3 years old so maybe the tech changed but I can skip the JSON.parse() method entirely and just access and print properties of the pasted objects as you would any other javascript object. I don&#39;t have to emulate a string and then parse. Did something change or are there advantages I am missing? <br><br>I know I still hear JSON mentioned a lot so I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m missing something obvious or key. Thanks to anyone who sees this and can offer feedback/guidance. &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: I just read about the advantage of JSON files for transmitting data and now see that they are more like a database file with specific formatting than a functional block of code. <br><br>So I can see why you&#39;d use them, but I&#39;m still confused as to why I can access and manipulate the object members without using JSON.parse(). Thanks again.

When converting the JSON into a string we use backticks instead of double or single quotes because you can only use backticks to create a multiline string.

Kid you should be a model in your spare time.
My question is, does JSON have to have the same keys for each object? so following your example, do you need CEO on the 2nd company even though it&#39;ll be filled with &quot;null&quot;?

Generally JSON is regarded as a hands-down better alternative over XML when there is no demand for things like XSL-based operations (or their logical equivalents employing different tech).  Now, truth be told, I am rusty on the whole XML bit, especially on the namespacing stuff, but it&#39;s my understanding that while JSON would nest oblects, XML would use referencing to point to other objects listed in the stream (perhaps to be received later) which, demands a more stream-oriented approach (processing an object before it&#39;s fully populated with external references), instead of going depth-first as in the example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=375">6:15</a>.  I understand that one COULD use the same approach in JSON, but the key difference is that XML leaves you no choice, and it&#39;s a good thing, imo.  Then there&#39;s a schema validation thing and XPath for data selection...  Am I missing something?  And if not, it would be nice if you could maybe give examples as to what scenarios would make XML preferable.  Thank you.

Great Tut..
It is a good practice to start the opening brackets on a new line so your eyes will not bleeding and both opening and closing brackets will be indented equally.<br><br>{<br>      &quot;key&quot;: value&quot;,<br><br>}
{<br>  &quot;invalidCustomNetwork&quot;: {<br>    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CLOSED&quot;,<br>    &quot;networkName&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;unconnectedAccount&quot;: {<br>    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CLOSED&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;activeTab&quot;: {},<br>  &quot;metamask&quot;: {<br>    &quot;isInitialized&quot;: true,<br>    &quot;isUnlocked&quot;: true,<br>    &quot;isAccountMenuOpen&quot;: false,<br>    &quot;identities&quot;:<br><br>What is that mean true or false, or CLOSED , see above
Hi, great video, wat about using an app like Postman to validate json response by drilling down objects and object attributes? A big bunch of people struggle to do just dat and it seems like the perfect tutorial for you to make. Just my 2ct. Good job on the channel!

Thank you for this great video. Love how you show examples and your explanation is easy to follow and understand.  A friend sent me this video as I‚Äôm new to json.  Very grateful.
extremely helpful
So JSON is simply for storing data in a way that other languages can read?
I may missed the point, but if its in a seperate file, why copy it to the js file?
great

Awesome video, per usual. One question I had was what is the purpose of JSON? I realize in the video you reference its lightweight and easy to send back and forth because of its small file size, but I still am curious about JSON&#39;s main purpose. In my bootcamp many of our repos have a package.JSON with dependencies, scripts, etc.. Are these in a JSON file because they are easier to send back and forth or is there some other reason? What am I missing?
why do you blink so much
thank you
Great video
that was an incredibly concise and helpful video

I&#39;m not a programmer.<br>I&#39;m watching this video because I recently deleted my youtube channel but I wanted to save my playlists somehow, so I downloaded some files with the IDs of the videos I had in them.<br>Back in 2019, there was a fast trick to create a playlist by searching the IDs of several videos separated by commas, but it seems to no longer work.<br>I asked what to do and someone replied &quot;All you need is YouTube API&quot; but didn&#39;t explain shit. I&#39;m having a headache, but this video is so clear that I understood most of it, thanks a lot!

How to make the dynamic value as the key in nested JSON
Can you go over how you get yo hair like that
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to do an advanced JSON video, but I never really know the right way to import JSON files into my code. I know the readfile syntax is different in different languages, and even between Node.js vs. client-side js. It would be cool to see a walk through on best practices for that.
Thank you for your clear &amp; stunning explanation ! I‚Äôve found dozens info of json , but not until I took your lesson then I finally realize what json is ! Appreciate!
Great lesson.  Sorry I&#39;ll have to watch again because I fell asleep halfway.  Not your fault, I just walked 18 holes and well, I guess the fresh air did me good.
I still wonder what is secret to that hair style ü§î,
json has global variables that can be assigned to other properties and how?
the speed is just right
Nice hair.
This is a very good tutorial. It also increases the font size.
Very less information
Its was really useful, indeed, everything I needed to get my instance of a problem out of the ground!
I&#39;m a beginner making a game in Godot, i was trying to make an inventory system using a tutorial when the tutorial started using .json files, i was slightly scared i&#39;d have to learn another programming language, but thankfully this doesn&#39;t seem to complex, thanks

Hi Sir, how do I obtain a table that auto-populate. Meaning row could be added automatically.
Very useful since im new to JSON thank u web dev simplified for making this video
It would be more clear if you can add an example explaining how JSON acts as a translator between two programs or services;
i think this is the best video i saw that explains JSON.<br>great job<br>btw, i think that for very very simple data structures, an .INI file is even easier and simpler (but not widely spread, and not for the web, REST etc&#39;)
Hi, May I know what software you used to create the video for explaining the process of creating a JSON Object. And Great Tutorial Mate, Thanks for Sharing with us.

But have you heard of JSTAN (JavaScript Tabular Array Notation)?<br><br>Regular repeating JSON Array with space-wasting redundant field names:<br>[<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 1, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;One&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 2, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Two&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 3, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Three&quot;}<br>]<br><br>The equivalent more compact JSTAN &quot;table&quot;:<br>[<br> [&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;],<br> [1, &quot;One&quot;],<br> [2, &quot;Two&quot;],<br> [3, &quot;Three&quot;]<br>]<br><br>JSTAN is still valid JSON, just a more compact way of storing data from an array of non-hierarchical objects of the same type. You might call it a JSON <del>design pattern</del> storage pattern.
I think I understand, but what is the output. Can you give an example?
its 12 minutes
Thank you very much
Just the Video that I was looking Short &amp; Sweet
Me and my team are making a game with this!<br>Yes, a game! We learned the basics of JSON, i think we can do it! :D
I am new to coding and still confused after watching this video. It is still unclear to me what the difference between JS and JSON is (other than some syntax rules). in other words: what can JSON do that JS can&#39;t? I mean, the small syntax differences don&#39;t look relevant enough for me to care enough about JSON. Anyone has an answer? Thanks in advance.
Thanks for this, still struggling how to make an object dictionary iterable but this helped me learn the basics

Excelent. Thanks
Thank you
Your cute!!!
Is it compulsory for JSON to be wrapper aorund {}
I dont understand, why do you create the json file but then just copy and paste the content inside the same html file. Whats the point of the json file then and how do you call and show its information?
how to use nested json
At the end of all that, you still didn&#39;t explain why there is a need for JSON files if you are going to duplicate the same exact data in your JavaScript.  It would make more sense if you showed the Javascript pointing to the JSON file for the data.
Disclaimer: Don&#39;t use dates or undefined in JSON. Also, comments are not supported in JSON (please save us, we need information about our properties!).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> colon*
there are people who simply have that something when it comes to teaching others, your ability to explain it to an idiot in 10 something minutes is a gem, do you have a course or something?
JSON is just fancy array
Gracias

Hello. Can I know how to add third company in the example you gave in the json file using python?
Great stuff, as usual. But please go a little slower. For those of us typing along it&#39;s sometimes hard to keep up. I imagine it&#39;s not necessary to copy and paste your JSON file into the HTML file, so a tutorial on including or embedding it would be helpful. Maybe you have one, I&#39;ll have to search.
u blink too much that i started blinking consciously
Just amazing dude

Your video is awesome. Adding to that you&#39;re freakin handsome ;)
Excellent video
What if I want to modify any values in JSON file/object, how do I do that?
Awesome
Not blinking is an illusion. And so is death XDXDXD
What&#39;s the point of the json file if you&#39;re just going to copy it&#39;s contents into the html file?  Would of been much more useful to end the video showing how that json file is used in a real world example.
Do you have a website?
This is the way all video tutorials should be.  Content is good.  Not only that, you explain things thoroughly, and enunciate very clearly.  And, in addition, you use a readable font size and contrast, so that I can read the code from across a room.  I&#39;m going to have to see what other videos you have.  I can only hope that you put out a lot more tutorial videos.
Thanks very clean up code.
My compliments to you! I&#39;m just following a course including JSON in the office but it is NOT as clear as you are! I thank you so much for your great job  in explaining so clearly such a concept.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> you called a colon a semi-colon. (edit) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> as well.

Easiest explanation of JSON on youtube
Crisp and Clear. Thank you
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=370">6:10</a>, if Kyle is Joey&#39;s friend, wouldn&#39;t it be repeated infinitely?<br><br>Kyle&#39;s friends value would include the Joey object, which would include the Kyle object, which would include the Joey object, and so on.
So wait- is a JSON file essentially a string literal?
Why do we need double quotes in JSON
I&#39;m just reviewing it again! I&#39;m starting to really understand it.
dude, you have a talent for teaching like no other. Not your first video I&#39;ve seen and not last. Great content

Hello Kyle~ can you make a video about dependent dropdown list in javascript and json? :)
&#39;&#39;comment&#39;&#39; : &#39;&#39;thank you for teaching me!&#39;&#39;
Kyle you are {&quot;TheKingOfCode&quot;,} or even &quot;Kode&quot; never before have I seen or heard such a clear and concise explanation of code of any kind, you got the gift. America is starving for talented teachers. You have just made a programmer out of me and that&#39;s not artificial intelligence, but a quantum leap for me after all these years. Thank you for sharing Kyle; &quot;King of Code&quot; or Kode.
I just wanted to learn this to make a Minecraft Java mod addon....
It is truly impressive that he didn&#39;t blink once in the video!
Very useful and to the point.  Thanks
You&#39;ve improved a lot since then, congrats
Why would you copy and paste the contents of the .json file to your .html file? Why create a .json file then? Isn&#39;t there a way to reference/import the .json information?
Thank you so much for this. The last part of the video was slightly confusing and I couldn‚Äôt see where you were clicking too. Please do another video just fully breaking down that last part. Also, when you were explaining the first part you used different brackets and on the second part you started off with the square brackets why is that?
Really great idea to tailor with JSON... reminds me a lot like .NET with Delegates (Patternization techniques with attributes that hold values). Thank you for showing!
you&#39;re a handsome programmer : )
doing this for mc
Thank you for the amazingly simple, yet thorough, explanation of JSON. I&#39;ve always wanted to learn it and you made it so simple. I&#39;ve always fine through my code of the current project I&#39;m working on to add JSON and it&#39;s amazing :)
This was so succinct, thank you
I learned something!
Excellent,Thanks. Request you to show how you record YouTube Videos.
I‚Äôm Json, so it‚Äôs you guys how‚Äôs been fucking about with me!
Somebody please explain to Kyle what a (semi)colon is!
Great tutorial

All hail to the Jason
So, if I understand correctly, classes in JSON can be compared to dicts in Python?
Very nice explanation subs
Can&#39;t you just call the index.html file using a function embedded in the Html file?<br>thanks again for the demonstration üëç
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=360">6:00</a> shouldn&#39;t `friends`&#39;s value be just an object? An array is redundant since the value is a single object.<br><br>Edit: JSON is a subset of JS not a superset<br><br>Edit2: how do you send JSON? How do you convert an object to JSON? How do you practically use it (get/post requests)? So much necessary information left out...

call me a bird bc imma nest so much with this knowledge
It was a very good and helpful video, but why should I create a .json file when I copy it over the my script anyways?
But why is json used? Did I miss something..
great explained! i like listen to you:)
Sir AApke paon kahan hai?? üòÉü§™
This is an awesome tutorial to start with JSON, As part of this tutorial, we can use an online tool to form JSON and understand,  For my Work, I am using <a href="https://jsonformatter.dev/">https://jsonformatter.dev</a> website

but can i add JSON  to HTML without putting whole string of JSON into HTML? like eg.  &lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; for javascript folder?<br>is there anything like &lt;script src=&#39;companies.JSON&#39;&gt;&lt;script&gt; ?
Why did he copy json data to HTML file while json file already had data?<br><br>Cannot access the data from .json file?
{<br><br>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,<br>&quot;age&quot; : 102,<br>&quot;address&quot;: &quot;DC&quot;,<br>&quot;subject&quot;:&quot;Json is easy and can be changed to list with loop in js &quot;,<br>&quot;continueMakingVideo&quot;: true<br><br>}

Can we connect the JSON file with the JS file instead of copy and pasting??
Including JSON.stringify would be more perfect. But the content is high quality üëçüëçüëçüòä
Very compact and succinct. (Y)
JSON is great way to transfer data specially while implementing APIs. Sometimes when you print JSON in logs, you see an unformatted string. I have found <a href="https://jsontoolbox.com/">https://jsontoolbox.com</a> to be a great way to format multiple such JSON on the same page.
thank you
be more specifique next time
Hello, do you have a video on how to configure the json API feature in the TP-LINK Archer MR200 router.  The target host is an Android mobile phone only
You look really young how old are you
I finally know what JSON is after nearly a year of coding :)
Thank you!
I&#39;m so glad JSON is used over XML.
How to deal with a nested array in JSON?
üëç
Clear explanation! You&#39;re really helping me out :-D
how does he get his json file to integrate with the html? i lose him at minute mark 9:28 and forward. any help would be appreciated, ty
Seems I already know most of this from minecraft :D
luv you man..
If we can do the same in Javascript then why we use JSON?
very nice explanation
Is JSON files some sort of DATA flat-file that is then access by JavaScript or some other application?
God damn json syntax is unintuitive and hard to read, are you kidding me. That friend array of users camouflages into pure ass, how are you supposed to keep track of where you are with that many lines of strings.<br> <br>It&#39;s a lot easier to grasp the separation of a new variable/object when the variable type has to be declared at the start, in other languages.
Thank you very much
This was great. In SEO,  we use JSON LD for Schema markup! This helped a lot!
If you just copy / pasted the info in the end, what was the point of the json file? Couldn&#39;t you have just keyed it into the html page to begin with? I&#39;m confused.
Excellent explantaion, thanks :)
why didn&#39;t you explained how to import data from the json file to js program?
you just made my day, you gave me a great idea how to solve my problem by creating an array of objects. thanks man
can I use json as a small database? and what are the advantages and disadvantages?
Thanks man, I will follow you videos for sure!!!
Overall, this video is very well done, but you mixed up the words colon : and semicolon ;.

I think the video was very good. I started JavaScript 1 month ago. I know some basics and with that video I catch the logic very fast. Continue the good work my friend
Please make a video on API‚Äôs how they work between front end and back end. Where does the Json , XML files used during API integration<br>Thanks in advance
the only helpful thing ive found on json files thank you sm
Thanks dude
Nice just learn what i needed
For me, it&#39;s better to put your JavaScript file below the body on the html. Because it&#39;s a different code  when you write it on javascript. And i&#39;m having a little bit of confusion. But other than that, I&#39;ve learned all of your videos &#39;til now.
one of the most confusing videos, i have seen ever
Great presentation. Thank you.
Thank you üëèüëè
why is this important why couldent you just make an object in js to begin with?
Was greatly insightful :&#39;)
Great video! I have one quibble though: you said &quot;semicolon&quot; instead of &quot;colon&quot; a couple of times. Just thought I&#39;d point this out as it may confuse some people.
i dont see the index.html

So nice to get that at the first go of learning
Is there any standardization for json response?
very well said, thanks for the tutorial. question, hm do you have or are you going to create a tutorial on how to use JSON in sending and receiving data to and from an API. cheers
This video should be in Top 10 Anime Betrayals bc it titled learn JSON in 10 minute, but is 12 minute? long? Author explain. am v confusion

That was very efficient and effective. Thank you sir!
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> and twenty seconds later, you called a colon a semicolon.

What if the value is a function
this is great for me, I&#39;m not a developer but you explained it perfectly.
Thanks for creating this informative and easy to follow tutorial.  I am new to JSON.  Can you please tell me what program you are using to write this code in?
Why is it necessary to convert the JSON to a string within the HTML?
Thanks man.
I noticed in the example u gave that the objects were closed in a boxed bracket but I thought a json code is encompassed in a curvy bracket. Please can you elaborate?  Thank you

Why is the key value enclosed in quotes?  What information is added that simply interpreting anything to the left of a colon as a key.  The quotes just seem to be unnecessary extra typing.

Hi, is there any chance you could help me with some basic JSON for Sharepoint conditional formating?
You keep saying semicolon when you mean colon. (Semi colon ;  colon : ). It‚Äôs very important for correct syntax.
Very clear and concise. Thank you so much and congratulations for your video.

Your videos are easy to understand
simply simple, thanks!!!
I perfectly agree with @Marsh Wetland: Perfect pacing and explanation! Thank you! Just one question: what&#39;s the difference between console.log(companies) and console.log(JSON.parse(companies))? Didn&#39;t you say that JS understands JSON by itself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=570">9:30</a>), so why parsing?
Excellent presentation. Thanks for sharing

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> that&#39;s a colon.
I prefer JSON over YAML. JSON is easier to read!
This is the best video I have came across till now on JSON. Thanks mate.
For the first time I actually understand what is JSON is .. thank you üòä. Can you please do some tutorials on Creating API&#39;s to download data from web??
is it possible to get key by passing a value in JSON <br><br>for Eg:<br>{ &quot;id&quot; : [ {&quot;1&quot;:&quot;abcd&quot;},<br>             {&quot;2&quot;:&quot;efgh&quot;} ] }<br><br>enter &quot;abcd&quot;<br>and get 1 as output
Around 4.40 you kept saying semi-colon instead of colon; other than that which was confusing, it was a very good instroduction to JSON
Hi Kyle, Thank you for the time spent making this video only to share it for free.<br><br>I want to make a clarification - first I am a beginner developer. Do we have any significant difference between json created for use in a JS program with those created to be used with other programming languages (In my own case, python)?<br><br>Here is an example of my iteration:<br><br>{<br>&quot;name&quot;: [&quot;Emmanuel&quot;], <br>&quot;age&quot;: [23],<br>&quot;gender&quot;: [&quot;male&#39;]<br>}<br>Will this work if I call it using say JS?

Excellent video thank you. I have a very basic question: why write the CEO of Small Business null instead of an empty string? Is there any advantage to having null?
awesome
Very Useful
Short yet on point. Thanks man.
Why did u say JSON is lightweight, I made a comparison to CSV, JSON is like 3 times more of the file size of CSV.
Help helpful. Kindly consider making a short video on API
thx so much!
thanks man

in JSON first need start from { } and only then you can use array []

Hi, I just found your videos and I like them a lot! <br>I&#39;m having trouble moving JSON data (that I receive from an API) from my server to a separate JS file (on the frontend) where I have functions set-up to process it and display the parts I want in my HTML. I thought this project would be a fairly simple Express App, but I&#39;m totally lost right now. I watched your middleware video, so I&#39;ll tinker some more and see what I can figure out...<br>Thanks for making videos!!
Thank you for video. Very helpful üëçüèª
wouldn&#39;t you want your html document to use the actual .json file instead of embedding the same code you could have simply written into your javascript.  In short, shouldn&#39;t you have shown us how to embed the .json file or am I missing something?
Am I the only one who couldn&#39;t get over the inverted opening double-quotes in &quot;hobbies&quot;? Other than that, a very informative video - great content!
Thank you bro, that really helped a lot.
Hi Kyle, thank you for the video! Liked and subscribed!<br>I hope you could help me out, I have a PHP file with JSON in it and it&#39;s working well.<br>But the JSON code is a mess so when I try to make it prettier using some tools to add new data to it, it loses functionality.<br>Befoire: var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{&quot;square&quot;:{&quot;silver&quot;:{&quot;100x100&quot;:{&quot;squareFull&quot;:{&quot;PRODUCT&quot;:&quot;261&quot;,&quot;SKU&quot;:1732, THIS IS WORKING<br>After:     var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{<br>  &quot;square&quot;: {<br>    &quot;silver&quot;: {<br>      &quot;100x100&quot;: {<br>        &quot;squareFull&quot;: {<br>          &quot;PRODUCT&quot;: &quot;261&quot;,<br>          &quot;SKU&quot;: 1732,<br>          &quot;PRICE&quot;: 60.45,<br>          &quot;OLD_PRICE&quot;: &quot;65.00&quot;,<br>          &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;/catalog/zerkalnaya_plitka/zerkalnaya_plitka_kvadrat/serebryanaya_kvadratnaya_zerkalnaya_plitka/?oid=1732&quot;<br>        } This is not working
Great tutorial! But what I was missing: what about dates (and timestamps)?
I know I&#39;m a bit late but instead of copying the json into the js, how would you simply make a variable with the content of the json file? As a dummy example that wouldn&#39;t actually work: let variable = file(name.json).content
Very useful video, thanks!

I need to convert the json file into dataframe using python or r.
How to read this type of dataset in python?. Because i have the same type of dataset having object dictionary and list all those things.
Why build the file if all you are going to do is cut and paste it?<br>Isn&#39;t there some sort of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include">#include</a>?<br><br>Why put it in quotes when all you are going to do is parse it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=542">9:02</a> but... what is the point of the companies.json-file that you created, when you&#39;re just copying and pasting from it? You could have just declared it in your html-file to begin with üßêWhy did you make a .json-file?
Thank you for the information, its useful
This was a fantastic explanation, thank you so much!
thank you!
Good but it‚Äôs a Colin : not a semicolon ;
How do you read a JSON file from another HTML file, as you did in the video, but without copying and pasting the code? something like export/import?
Please correct me if I am wrong, but to leave notes in your script, use &lt;/item&gt;?
Simply thank you very much

If you forget those double quotes for keys, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.
super
Maybe I just missed the point. Why didn‚Äôt you just type all the json code in JS at first place but instead of a separate json file then copy from it? The json file should be imported, right?
Thank u for explaining so well
wow, is very simple to understand what you explain and know how to work with JSON.
So you copied the whole json file to that html file, so what&#39;s the purpose to create a json file when you can write all of that in the html file?
&quot;And in the next course, we&#39;ll talk about the difference between colon &amp; semi-colon ...&quot;
What‚Äôs the point of json?
I don&#39;t get it... Why would you type code in a json file just to copy/paste it?  How do you access the code that&#39;s on the json file?
An error occurred =&gt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
Who is Jason?
i cant emulate my code some help please?
No,I learned JSON at 12 minute
I like your JSON  Video, one of the best.
Thanks for making this understandable.
I had a couple questions, instead of copying and pasting the code from the JSON file, are you able to just call the other file that you had already created? If you can&#39;t call the initial JSON file you had created, why even create the file? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to just code in the html file from beginning?
Can I get your mail please? üòä
Very clear and informative, Thanks!!
thanx
this isnt 10minutes this is 11 minutes
Nice! Thanks so much!!
Great video. I think this is the best tutorial I have seen about JSON. Thank you very much.
Excellent video. Congratulations!,
Could you please do a tutorial on password resets with the passwords declared in JSON file(I now know how to do that from this vid) but linked to JS file and how to call it on the html :) <br>also, with my html my on click or oj-on-action does not want to work but i have done so much research and still struggling<br>Thank you, any help will be greatly appreciated
Just keep it up bro....It was really json in 10 mins.. Thanks
Super Simple and Fast Explanation
I have a simple question . when you are copying all the data from json file into the main html portion (script) then what is the use of creating Json file at all???????????. you should demonstrate to link the json file and then use the data inside of it using javascript . Ans me anyone
It was very good videos in a very easy way. I&#39;m also a teacher but I have good very good grip on PHP. Want to work on python too so Can u make a video on python with web development?? Without using any framework like flask Or something. Just like PHP. We write our script file without any special software and for e.g. anaconda üêç. Your response will be appreciable for me. Thank you.
Very nice üëç
Your explanation is so good
Watch at 2x and learn JSON in 6 minutes üòÇ
Explaining JSON in 10 minutes &quot;simplified&quot; is even more elongated than it takes to explain it in depth and formally at a university xd. Also calling JSON as a &quot;superset of Javascript&quot; is simply a fale statement, lol.
Actually, they&#39;re not semi-colons. They are colons - two dots. Semi-colons have dot and comma.
You lied it&#39;s 12 minutes not 10
Indeed this is Web Dev Simplified. Keep up the good work.
Very well explained.  To the point, and just what I needed :)
I want to like this video twice
So what about data?
json.parse i just parsed this comment
I cant thank you enough for making these quick guides man. Ure an hero!
Nice video! Well explained the concept
You keep referrening : as semicolon or double colon. It&#39;s just colon.
Very clearly explained, I am grateful for your tutorials, thanks mate!
Thank you, brother. <br>From Bangladesh üáßüá©
Hey, is there away to assign a file to an &quot;input&quot; like a &quot;word or excel&quot; in html and then read the contents  from js? The thing is,  i want the file to automatically be select and when i press a button it reads the info.
very good video.
So can I put down on my Resume that I know JSON now?
Great. Super easy to understand! Thanks you.
java script please
Cover AVRO format pls
Dude, you keep saying semi-colon. A semi-colon is a ;   you mean colon, which is :

Thank you sir
I just saw my first video about JSON and don&#39;t get the big-deal of it. If it is just to store data, I could store it in any form (txt file, in a database, etc). What&#39;s the point of JSON? Where is its power?

GREAT video
nice video. helpful.
I thought JSON was like a new programming language but just an installment of JavaScript like React and jQuery.<br><br>Also what is the purpose of JSON.stringify?
Very nice. Do we need to convert json to base 64 string before sending over the internet?
I guess this is also good to learn for minecraft commands?
Thanks. This video was very useful to me. It helps me understand the nic concept of JSON.
thank you very much this was so helpfull  , &lt;3
Awesome tutorial. Thank you sir!
Please edit audio wherever you have said semicolon but meant a colon.
Áõõ‰∏ñÁæéÈ¢úÔºÅ
Niice one
; semi colon<br>: colon<br><br>Good video though!
great video thanks for the simple explanation really helps break it down nice and simple, quick question can different objects have different number of properties, like in your companies example let&#39;s say big cooperation has name, numOfEmployees, ceo, rating but second element in array json object small start up has 6 properties lets say numOfBranches and something else?
<b>Visible_happiness.json</b>
Thanks man..
What avout two way relations? For example friends.‚Äã A friend with B.‚Äã The JSON of A has an array of all of his friends. Contained is of course the JSON of B. But the JSON of B also has an array with all of his friends. Contained is the JSON of A and so. How does this work?
You handsome
It&#39;s a colon, not a semicolon

am i the only one that realized that he blinked for the first time in an intro?
hey web dev simplified would you mind answering one of my silly questions related to python? please let me know thanks!
: is a colon and not semi colon..
Thank you, that was super interesting
So in simple words JSON is like classes and objects of C++
sir blinks alot.

Excellent
why is he so cute
Nice Job!!! Just started learning JSON. Glad I find this video first.
Loved this video! Do you have a video covering what a beginner should use to write JSON? Also, how to apply it to real life applications?
anything in JSON is valid JS.. so what`s the point of JSON.parse when you already had access to that JSON before that? (i guess that`s just an example to show both ways ?) . I`m assuming you use JSON.parse only when you make an api request and get your JSON as a string and not as an array.  Please correct me if I`m wrong
Hi Kyle
Thank you!
Excellent tutorial! Clear content and quick presentation. Good job.
not semi-colon between k-v pairs.  full colon.
The way of the presentation of the contents in each of your videos is really good. Thank you for these great tutorials. I have a request if possible- do you have the plan to make some videos related to programming. For example, Algorithm and Data Structures etc. and how they can be practically used in Web Development (if needed).<br>Thanks again. :)
Hi bro, hope you doing great!<br>I really don&#39;t have much idea about Json, but you gave me what I am looking for, thank you so much your clear and easy to catch about Json, keep it up bro<br>Thanks again!<br>Anthony
I really enjoyed this quick start JSON tutorial. You are very clear and provided enough info that i can write my own. Thank you
I just understand 20% when you talk because i&#39;m my english not well , but I focus this video i can more understand about Json, Thank you so much.
Have been following now am becoming an expert in JS... Thanks buddy I need your contact.
you mean colon not semicolon
Great video, thank you!
love your video very very sensible thanks keep up on this
Great video for a starter like me, i wanted to see how you can call a json data file within the executable script to be read as an input file (not copy/pasting the whole content), how easy is that?
Simple and crisp information, Thanx bud
Learn JSON in 12 minutes lol. Great vid!
My questions (I am new to programming):<br><br>1. Consider those values in JSON need to get from database, what can we write in order to loop all the data from database before putting into html to be used?<br><br>2. Then, how do we link the JSON file to html without have to copy all the things in JSON to script first like you did in the video? (Can we put a variable in html and let JSON return to them?)
Can we add conditional statement within JSON data?
Awesome, thanks!
&quot;That was awesome ! ! ! thanks&quot;
Simple and good video
Thanks for the video. Your introduction to the JSON topic was paced and complete. It really helped get me started. Nice work.
With my most recent exposure to programming/code of any kind having been an intro to C, this feels like dark witchery. Code that doesn&#39;t care what type your inputs are - wow, imagine that.
Wow. Nicely explained. Thank you so much! üëçüèº
You did a wonderful job Kyle of giving a clear, succinct and thorough explanation of JSON.<br>I will definitely be coming back for more tutorials from you.
Great explaination man üôå
Thank you.
Well done
Awesome
Kyle, your hair and eyebrows are really nice üëå
Great job! I need help getting json code into WordPress html block.

Damn, dude, are you a model or something?
I think JavaScript is superset of JSON
Outstanding video.  My only comment is to let you know that the &quot;:&quot; is a colon, not a semicolon.  The semicolon contains a comma as in &quot;;&quot;.  Best regards. :-)
What kind of keyboard do you use? It sounds so good.
Excelent tutorial. Right to the point, clear and perfect speed to follow and understand what you are doing. Subscribed!
Wow, thank you! It was so hard  to understand how json and parsing works. I have been looking at guides that were too confusing!
Subscribed after one minute of your video. Thanks alot for great content üëçüëç
good
how you do the live refresh? I mean you save it and the console refreshes directly.
Great tutorial ! Thanks for sharing
Quality content, mate, thanks for this one.<br>I&#39;m at a new job dealing with APIs, and your content is just what I was looking for to understand JSON better.<br>Liked and subscribed, keep up the good work.
Excellent tutorial
This is an incredible video! I feel better now that I have an understanding of JSON and all this in just 12 minutes. If others were to teach me, Half-Life 3 Episode 4 would have been released, and I still wouldn&#39;t have gotten a thing.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=590">9:50</a> you added the apostrophe &#39; , and made it in to string. How you do that? Is that somehow possible in the PhpStorm?
JSON is my street name.
Apologies if this is stupid question, but why do we need the JSON file if we just paste its contents into the HTML? Is there another way to get the JSON data without pasting?
Could u plz show how make selection click in html page and select json file and load json data and display json data in HTML page in format table.
Thanks man, cleared up some things very nicely, very informative
Thanks you&#39;re a life saver.
I&#39;m new at this but at the end, wouldn&#39;t it be:  ((companies)[0].name)    instead of (companies)[0].name)    (I added an extra paren at the beginning) or is it actually the way you stated?
Rather than surrounding the JSON by ` backticks , can we not give the user the object value of the JSON as he will still have an option to JSON.stringify it. And most of the times, the user may require the object of JSON instead of the string
Hey thank you for the video.  I want to be an exceptional programmer and these are very helpful videos to learn different coding languages. Much appreciated.
Thank you so much sir! I am in the process of becoming Azure certified and i really wanted to iron-clad my understanding of ARM templates which are written in JSON format. This video was a wonderful explanantion of the creation and syntax used in such files. Thanks alot bro!
hi,i have a question ,what is diffence:<br> [{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}] <br>and<br> {&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}
God bless you bro !..
In the example user.json for hobbies is the double quotation correct?(both closing double quote)<br>And the array element for &quot;hobbies&quot; i.e. &quot;weight lifting&quot; have you used the correct
Informative !
So basically the JSON objects are dictionaries.
Hmm, You do realise there are occasions where you say &#39;semicolon&#39; when in fact you mean &#39;colon&#39;?   I started noticing it in the 4th minute.
just a quick question <br>why did you use [ ] first ???<br>I thought we use { } to open and close
It supports bouillon? What about consomm√©?

Start to finish, coding a rest API from Corvid
How do you import the json file in the JS file instead of copy pasting the entire json code? Not sure I followed that part
Thanks
Sorry if I missed something, but whats the point in this double thing you did?<br>I removed the backticks and also I removed the JSON.parse and  inner parenthesis and it works just fine.<br>Any reason they must be added? Thanks for gr8 video!
Hi folks, maybe this is a stupid question but when we insert JSON inside of an HTML document do we have to copy all JSON lines of code inside of HTML or there is a shorter way to work on it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=325">5:25</a> why you wrote &quot;Hobbies&quot; with same double quotes both sides ... is that a mistake by you???
could you pls make a video about &quot;implicit grant flow&quot; and how to implement it?
So what was the json file for? Didn&#39;t look like you needed it at all. You just put everything you wrote in the json file in the script tag. This doesn&#39;t really show or explain what json is even for. You didn&#39;t even use the json file for anything. I am very confused.
He&#39;s too pretty for me to focus on the topic....
One thing that I‚Äôd change about JSON... allow trailing commas in lists.  So many times I‚Äôve forgotten to sort out the commas when adding/removing/swapping lines in JSON files, and then spent time wondering why my code‚Äôs not working.  And, I‚Äôm not keen on all those quotes either... seriously, why do key names need to be quoted?
great video, thanks!
{<br>&quot;good&quot;: &quot;yes&quot;<br>}
That&#39;s 10 minutes in base 12...
It&#39;s a colon, not a semi colon.
Is this doable with Python aswell?
Cool My Friend
What compiler or ide is this?
You really cleared up all the confusion I had, thanks man üôèüôè
Brilliant!! Your work is impeccable. So easy hands on to JSON for dummies. Good :)
What is the best tool freely available to for Json and python?
Great video and Thank you!

Hey can you create a javascript program that is able to save, search, view, update and delete a data to and from a database table and should use JSON object or Javascript object in passing and receiving data???
Hey bro how do I make it so that VS code underlines my mistakes (if I make any)? Thank you.
Thanks Mate. it was really helpful to me in understanding JSON basics
Really good tutorial, only 1 minor thing. <br>In the end you say you can do anything with the newly passed JSON object that you can do with a normal javascript object.<br>There is no &quot;JSON Object&quot;. The JSON has been parsed from a String to an Object so calling it a JSON Object is incorrect, it&#39;s just an Object :)
it helped
HOW AMAZING !! I Love it excellent explanation <br>Thanks so much
Noob question: please explain in detail how to make output go to console as in the video.  Great explanation of json. I just had trouble following along in vs code cause console did not show results

Why would you build a companies.json file just to copy/paste its content into your index.html file? Why not let the &#39;companies&#39; variable in index.html equal the companies.json file (or &quot;JSON.stringify(companies.json)&quot; assuming that&#39;s indeed a real method)?

This was super helpful and clear, thank you so much!
Very nice and informative. Thanks
Thanks !!!
Really simple and straight forward - much appreciated
Thanks so much. Happy Coding :)
Thanks, just the information I needed to get started on a project using JSON data
I feel was feeling a bit intimidated by JSON, but you explained it really well and it makes much more sense now. Thanks!
Great little video! Nice job üòÄ

Your explanation was as cool as your look! <br>Hats Off Bro!
The simplicity of the explanation is mind blowing. Great video üëç
How you made the animations text?
Thanks for this. But I have a question. Wouldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t we call the json file rather than copying what&#39;s in the file in our html? seems redundant to have a file... Or am I missing something?

Love this ,Simple and effective.....I am so observed  that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=340">5:40</a> a confused quote at &quot;hobbies&quot;...just a thing üòú
Thanks for the video, but it&#39;s not a &quot;semi-colon&quot;.
Nice tutorial, but how do you let a variable equal to a JSON file content without manually copying and pasting?
Smooth Explanation....Now i know how to use JSON as a tester ..5 star for you
Thank you
Beautiful Way of explaining, So easy to follow and understand, and matters are spot on instantly. Kindly do more a systematic tutorial for Kotlin too. Thank you
You are great dude, this is the first video of your&#39;s I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m Subscribed!
wait a second. Why did you create a .JSON file if you just pasted the entire file into your html file? lol what was the point of having the .JSON file?
If you haven&#39;t already, please do an in-depth video on using Axios.get/put/post/patch/ etc . I&#39;m simply lost when it comes to referring to the DOM and trying to update the page using a database. :(
I cannot tell you how much I truly appreciate how you break everything down into bite-sized pieces of information! I felt such a wave of relief after watching this video. Seriously.

Besides confusing a colon with a semicolon this was an excellent tutorial. Thanks for sharing
Thanks for helping me hack pvz2 lmao
Thanks!
Thanks for the great tutorial!! Quick question - how do you write JavaScript code to read the data in the JSON file and store that info in a variable? :D
I don&#39;t know any programming. YouTube randomly recommended it. But I feel I learned something. Thank you.
Thank you.for clarifying this subject. I honestly feel as if I can understand how to use Json now. I do have a question. How do I rename a txt file to json so that roku will read it for direct publishing?
A tutorial on JSON? I find it odd but great video nevertheless.
can you make a video about consuming API with Fetch. please.
i can&#39;t than you enough .<br>you man is amazing.<br>you are my go to guy when i try to learn something complicated.<br>even though i am 2 min into the video<br>but i know i will understand in the end.<br>after the Promise video.<br>i trust you <br>thanks a lot &lt;3.
Awesome lecture!!

wow...thanks bro.... :)
If you&#39;re familiar with python JSON is a list of dictionaries, more commonly known as a hash map. One of the most efficient data structures that&#39;s used commonly to make fast code.
Thank you!

Thanks for the video. Trying to learn json and coffeescript before moving on to action cable for my rails development üòä
U copy pasted JSON DATA INTO JS but you didn&#39;t show how use json directly from file.Json
You are calling colon a semicolon?
Absolutely to the point !!!
watch in 1.25x speed. thank me later
Hi, Could you please share a video where we can create a JSON file using JavaScript and place at given path?
Thanks for being noob friendly LOL the best way to learn things is simply taking it from the beginning üåºüåºüåº /eva
Bad tutorial
very helpful. Thanks mate
I can&#39;t thank you enough. I was stuck with understanding both the idea and syntax with JSON until now. Thank you.
Quite informative!   PS: That&#39;s colon in the JSON not semicolon ... just a feedback. thaks
Thanks this helped, title is not click bait.
You start with saying that Json is stored in a separate Json file but then you copy it to a JavaScript file with no explanation on why you did this. I was thinking you were going to access the json file directly.
You have no idea how you&#39;ve helped. Thank you!<br>Subscribed.
It&#39;s beautifully presented.
Thanks very much!  Very helpful!
So clear and easy to follow. Thank you!
Thanks Mate! Love from India!!
A really great vid, except the &quot;all you need to know&quot; comment at the end which isn&#39;t correct. Anyway, thank you, a very useful pace and style. Please get a Patreon account.
What about with the other languages?
This is by far, the best!!
nobody:<br>Kyle: &quot;I like lifting weights.&quot;
great video. tks
Sorry not a pro here I&#39;m just starting out in programming, but could you please elaborate more on the uses of JSON ? I don&#39;t see why is it so significant the fact that it can be realized with OOP concept in most languages. Also, isn&#39;t it more efficient to store data in a database and manipulate them with SQL ? Thanks in advanced.
Thank you Sir
Solved One Of the  biggest doubt between json and objects. Thank you :-)
Ir kyle is joeys friend... wouldnt it end up in an infinite nesting issue?
Isn&#39;t it colon after Key? You&#39;ve been saying semi-colon. Its confusing!
Why is he keep blinking?
Is there a way to NOT copy and paste the entire json code into the script tag?
Instead of null, we should consider using a null value representation such as  -1 or even -1000,  some value that will display safely. So as to reduce headache for users who consume the json data!
This is really simpler than most JSON explanation I could find on the internet. You&#39;re doing great. Keep it up, bro!
Can you please do a video of &quot;How to integrate SQL code with JSON in 10 minutes&quot;? thx
I think I&#39;ve seen you before. I just can&#39;t remember where . . .
Awesome one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=565">9:25</a> how do i check that out in my browser
to the point and clear thank you! please keep these videos coming!
How do you read the json array from the file to achieve the same result without manually copying the information from &quot;user.json&quot; to the &quot;index.html&quot; file?
One tip: Don&#39;t start object keys names with number ;-)
Good One
If you want to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string that can be passed to a server then use let variableName = JSON.stringify(yourObject);
Your tutorials are world class but are you doing some sort of code with your blinking?
Keep making these awesome videos
Right ... Learn in 10 and forget in 7. We have to stop this tree of domination! Let&#39;s meet at 9 I&#39;ll give instructions for everybody. We&#39;ll swing the boat and fly away at speeds of 1 and 2. I&#39;ve noticed one thing... If I get paid well - I never forget things.
Good video. However. JSON is a subset of javascript not a superset. Also even to that there are exceptions. <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset">http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset</a>
Thank you.
Enjoyed it. Thanks
Your explanation is so clear and rightly paced. Thanks!
it&#39;s possible for 5 minutes or less if you make it for those who know javascript already. but for beginners, this 10 minutes wouldn&#39;t be enough. As I have known js for a long time, this is simplest explanation for json but a little too long.
Hi.Iam from India <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tq">#Tq</a>

Ur explaination is good and aslo pronounced
Simply awesome man , thank you !!
[{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}]
angularjs videos definitely would be great in your playlist.<br><br>btw nicely explained
Wow. Good articulation with nice voice.
wow, it&#39;s like shortest clip of complete tutorial
you are not using semi-colons but colons!
if the whole JSON text is copied in the script what is the need of JSON file and how to use it in script
Good tutorial, I understand all in one go. well explained in such a simple way.  Thanks
Just a perfect tutorial. Exactly how it should be done. Subscribed!
Great. Hey, I&#39;m stuck with parsing a nested json file in my python program. How to parse a nested json file?
Molto interessante!
good information.  tq
&quot;SUCH&quot; a great tutorial. Many thanks
Great JSON video! By the way, which font are you using in the video?
your videos are so helpful. God Bless u dude. can u make a video on how to use json, js,  and html to  pull data from  the json and put it  in the html webpage in a textbox or show how to pull information from a webpage  user  inputing text into a textbox into the json file.
You cleared all dark corners about JSON but when you started about Javascript and JSON man I lost the stream like a power failure. :( <br><br>But that&#39;s ok. I only wanted the JSON part. :)
You speak with just the right speed and clarity! BeautifulÔºÅ
Thank you for this tutorial ... Really great
i&#39;m literally just here cuz i want to create Minecraft bedrock mods because a new modding update is coming out and need to learn the basics lol.
you said &#39;semi-colon&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> ... is that a mistake or a &#39;semi-colon&#39; works as well as &#39;colon&#39;?
Hey are you the guy from coralfish12g?? Coz you both look identical
I still don&#39;t understand you literally just created a JS object, so what is JSON and why would you use it?
talk about simplicity... couldn&#39;t be more simplified
And yeah. You&#39;re beautiful
Thank You Sir.<br>I fully understand it.<br>Thanks again.
Perfect pacing and explanation. I just wonder at the diversity or randomness of your double quote marks, e.g. at time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=348">5:48</a>. I guess it&#39;s just an artifact of your font, but it really threw me.
I think you said that backwards: wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to say JS is a superset of JSON? And logically, only a subset would seem to guarantee compatiblity, a superset would by definition have things they subset doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just being pedantic, I guess.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,  you sir have achieved that. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thumbsup">#thumbsUp</a>
Thanks, man.  You know, I&#39;ve been studying web dev between working my 2 jobs, and after hearing people mention JSON more times than I can count, only found out what it was for about a week ago.  Appreciate you providing this brief explanation.
Well done !...Thank you for taking the time to produce such informative and to the point presentations. You have a new subscriber !
You keep calling &quot;colon&quot; a &quot;semi-colon&quot;
Really easy to understand and well-explained video. Much more helpful than reading old university slides, haha.
Does it work the same way in vs code for c++?
it&#39;s impressive how you the ideas were one by one and smooth to grasp, however on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=160">2:40</a> the type you call objects, isn&#39;t it a map? Since in java it&#39;s called like that!
So backticks instead of stringify???
Good Explanation
Quick &amp; professional explanation - exactly what I needed. Subscribed!
&quot;comment&quot; : &quot;That was awesome ! ! ! thanks&quot;
Very informative, brief and end-to-the-point. Many thanks :)
Excellent! Thanks a lot!
Loved the video and want to suggest <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/">https://jsonformatter.org</a> for all in one JSON tool to format and validate JSON data.
Thank you. I needed this to use the JSONDecode And JSONEncode Functions In Roblox Studio(:!.
so basically just an array of objects?
very useful video
I&#39;d like to connect to u on LinkedIn :)
I expected to learn how to write a JSONpath of a JSON field.
That&#39;s not semicolon. It&#39;s just colon.
[{<br>&quot;useful&quot;:  &quot;thanks&quot;<br>}, ]
Thank You Sir...You have simply explained the very simple thing
Absolutely Fantastic!! Keep up the good work <a href="http://bro.love/">Bro.Love</a> from India

I am neither a programmer or developer, but have been hacked by one! PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME!! I have a hard time describing what&#39;s goin on to other people who don&#39;t understand this type of thing, so basically they think I&#39;m crazy..I&#39;m so sorry for asking for your help! I know that you have more important things in life to worry about, but this is almost to the point of destroying mine :(
throwback to the old windows. Great video!
Thanks a lot. That was just a great and pleasant tutorial.
Very good explanation... clear and objective !  Great job.
Excellent!! Subscribed
thank you that was perfect!<br>pls do short explaining like this on git&amp;github
clear, clean and sharp!!!... very useful video!!!...
Would love if you made a Tutorial on jQuery!
Great video, really helpful
I always thought that a JSON file had to begin with curly brackets, but I see you using regular brackets in the demo. What&#39;s the rule here for the start of a JSON file?
Really well done and organised üëçü§ì
That was such a professionally styled tutorial video! You got full control over what you&#39;re gonna go through and you present with simple examples! It has not been often I&#39;ve seen performance like this on a channel of this size. You deserve to be much bigger, and I hope many more people will get to see this and benefit from it! Keep it up!
I hope you all enjoyed this quick video on JSON. If you have any topics you want me to cover in future videos let me know!

I thought json was a subset of JavaScript
Mate, good video but at several points you referred to colons as &quot;semicolons&quot;. Considering the severe importance of syntax in programming, I highly recommend leaving a pinned comment or attentive note in the description. Though I also understand this is a 6 year old video. So might not be worth the effort.
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> you say :&quot;semicolon&quot; yet type colons. How did you let this through a coding demo?

@webdevsimplified is there a reason at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=398">6:38</a> you don&#39;t begin with the &quot;friends&quot; nest before adding the regular user Kyle? Or is that just to showcase the possibilities? <br><br>I guess I am curious if you could just begin with creating an array of &quot;friends&quot;, for example, and have Kyle listed beneath? <br>Or is there a reason to him leading the beginning?

You start the video by referring to this punctuation mark ( : ) as a colon. We agree. At about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a>, you switch to semi-colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=301">5:01</a>, you switch back to colon. Then at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=317">5:17</a>, you switch back to semi-colon. Can you confirm it&#39;s a colon?

Always loved the way C++ got transitioned to the web.  And don&#39;t forget the way Sun Microsystems nmacro became html.  When we built a web of documents across multiple servers, did we programmer grads know we&#39;d built something that could become the worldwide web, back in 1987, no, we just thought how great is this cool document linking all the other documents, and then we went for a drink in the pub.  But I will always be nostalgic about C.

My god. I&#39;m an experienced developer and I know everything about JSON, but I saw my man&#39;s video and I clickedüòÇ
wowow nice explain bro
This is a semicolon ;<br>This is a colon:<br>JSON uses both but they are not interchangeable. <br>Each has a specific syntactical use.<br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=269">4:29</a>, starts getting them confused.

Good Explanation
Hey
HellO
So, I am a C++, and C# coder / game editor. When coming across an old hml site I wanted to link my discord server to the site as a side view and reformat it for my game/server that I host. In this moment I realized that even though I have been editing this site for some time now, I actually know next to nothing about the format its self or how it is layed out. Rather I have just been finding and changing the information already present. That being said I find this video very useful and my first step in the door to actually understanding hml and the benifets or switching to JSON. On that note for view back references i would really like to save these videos and i will definitely be subscribing. Thank you!

It would be good if you mentioned briefly an example on how you connect your JSON file to JS. In your tutorial you just copy paste the JSON text into your JS, but in a real situation, what / how do you work with this file? That&#39;s the only thing I still don&#39;t get... Thanks though, great content

I&#39;m learning  Json in 10min
Great
Not to be rude, but You ended with the line &quot;you know know everything you need to use JSON in your future projects,&quot; but all we did was write JS. What&#39;s the actual POINT of JSON? How do we get JS to actually pull information directly from the json file and save new data to it??? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere and all I can find is &quot;explanations&quot; that don&#39;t explain anything. They just show us a couple limes of code and say &quot;there you go!&quot;, like what the actual f*k.<br><br>The video was very well done, format-wise, but content-wise I would really like to see more, please.<br><br>Sorry if im being rash, I&#39;m just getting really frustrated trying to figure out this dang language.
It should NOT take 10 minutes to learn JSON

I may sound stupid for this, but why would we need Json when we can just write the same code in javascript which we wrote in json, its like I am writing my notes in rough book only for me to write it again in my fair book later

What are the benefits of storing your arrays in a JSON file, if you still have to bring the contents of the file in as a string and then parse it? Serious question, I‚Äôm brand new. To me wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to create the arrays in the JSON file and link the variable to the file like you would your style sheet so your html isn‚Äôt all crazy?
Very Very Informative!!!

Very good explanation! Straightforward and simple! Thanks for creating such content! You are helping loads of people
JSON is a subset of JS not a superset <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=71">1:11</a>
I am not currently a programmer or a web developer. I did however, learn some basic stuff 20 some odd years ago when it was first coming out (zero experience with JSON). Your info was good and easy to understand, but the most important thing that&#39;s missing is this: why would I want to do anything like what you showed us? The only thing I saw you do was create a bunch of objects with key/value pairs, copy and paste your object into Javascript, and then show the value of the variables in the console. Seems like a a lot of work for almost zero functionality. Please give a real world use that would let me know what I could do with a structure like this and explain why I would need to write a JSON file if I&#39;m just going to copy and paste it into a script. Why not just type it in the script? Or if you have another tutorial that covers that, I&#39;m glad to check that out as well. Thanks
Hello World
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> - You say semicolon, but you are using a colon. Looks like colon is right though?
gg
i just wanna point out that while json is super useful in web development, it&#39;s not JUST for web development.<br>anytime you need to do inter-process communication, json is there for you, specially if your processes are made in different languages. you just deflate your object into a json string(there are plenty of libraries that do this for you, or you can just do it yourself.) and the receiving process inflates it back to an object it can use.<br><br>i dont like it much for configuration files......for that i think yaml is better. it&#39;s more human readable.<br>but for sharing objects between processes of different languages it&#39;s amazingly good.
REST API  is EZ?

Still don&#39;t get it. Why copy the data out of json file and paste into the HTML file? What&#39;s the point then of the json file? Can&#39;t you just point the json file? And if you have a json file how do you display all the info in it onto a HTML page?
Very well explained.

Isn&#39;t storing keys as strings very inefficient as strings use a lot of memory (at least one byte per character) and are slow to check for equality to another string? Is there a way to use integers as json keys instead, like a C-array being indexed via integers?

You did a great job and kept your promise.  I did learn JSON from your short video, I&#39;ve heard of it but wondered what it was - but now my curiosity has been satiated!  Unfortunately I&#39;m a C and Assembly language firmware engineer and can&#39;t see many use cases for it.  Typically I do sort of equivalent things by exchanging binary data, each end of the communications using the same data structure defined in a common header file that overlays the binary data to encode/decode it - very terse and very fast.  I&#39;m sure JSON packets could themselves be parsed by writing a C function to do so, but I don&#39;t know if anything web related is ever written in &quot;straight&quot; C (not C++ which isn&#39;t C) - if you know of any such cases please let me know with a reply. Thanks ! üòä
Don&#39;t believe this crap, you won&#39;t <i>learn</i> anything in 10 minutes. Besides, GPT4 will do the job anyway, and better than you.

Thank you for this great video! You  explained json in very simple language and covered a lot of content.
Definitely thought some dude named Jason developed this format, disappointed.
colon : hehe not semi, just picking on you bro.<br>This is actually very useful to someone that is just wanting to dip their toes in JSON. Just don&#39;t do like he did at the end, lol. That doubles the load. You don&#39; tneed the entire thing. Parse it on output when needed. <br>But Very Good video man.

That was a good first look at json files but my negative is at the end you made the json file obselete by copy/pasting it&#39;s contents in to script tags.  <br>Would have been better to actually use the json file you created to pull out the name.

Reading the title of the video I was asking myself what is there to learn about json in such long 10 MINUTES!
ver good explanation
Kyle please help me with how to fetch data from Elasticsearch and Display it on React table. I have already designed it. But I get trouble in API calling
Standard English names:<br><b>{ and } are </b><b><i>braces</i></b> not <i>curly braces</i> =&gt; all <i>braces</i> are &quot;curly&quot; (Think of the British use of &quot;braces&quot; to mean [US/Canadian] &quot;men&#39;s suspenders&quot; and you&#39;ll see them.)<br><b>[ and ] are </b><b><i>brackets</i></b> not <i>square brackets</i> =&gt; all <i>brackets</i> are &quot;square&quot;<br><b>( and ) are </b><b><i>parentheses</i></b> (added here, just because the British get them wrong so often, calling any of these three sets a &quot;bracket&quot;)<br>Also, it would have been much better if you had used <b>standard ASCII quotation marks, instead of the word-processor &quot;smart quotes&quot;</b> (which you sometimes got wrong), because <b>JSON interpreters will NOT accept the &quot;curly&quot; versions of quotation marks as delimiting characters.</b>
I assume someone else has highlighted the error at time 4.29. &quot;...we would surround that name key in double quotes put a semicolon after it...&quot; No. Put a <b>**colon**</b> after it.  These small teaching errors can cause big debugging errors for learners later.  So far, except for this small detail, I really like the video.

I noticed that in your example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=315">5:15</a>, hobbies has a &quot;closing&quot; double quote up-front rather than an &quot;opening&quot; one like the previous items. Is this likely to cause an issue when running the code or is it just a font artefact that&#39;s ignored by the parsing software? Thanks.

Your screen is using smart quotes. This is invalid JSON. It is a common problem when a word processor (like Microsoft Word) is used instead of a code editor (like VS Code). Also, you called the separator character a semicolon, but it is a colon. You typed it correctly, but used the wrong term.<br><br>As this video is targeted to newbies, it is especially important to be accurate.

Two periods over each other is a colon ‚Äú:‚Äù.  A semicolon has a period and comma ‚Äú;‚Äù.  JSON key/value pairs are separated by colons (like in the video), but you kept saying semicolon ‚Äú;‚Äù.

Hi, Thank you for the Json short courses you really made easy to understand, Do you have courses on udemy, if yes how can I access them, under which name is it?
Very good explanation in the shorter time, thanks much!!!

In real life, where do json objects come from ?
const JSON = require(&#39;../../json.json&#39;)<br><br>[{<br>  &quot;YouTube Video Analysis&quot;: {<br>    &quot;Rating&quot;: 9,<br>    &quot;Reasoning&quot;: &quot;Whilst many should know this before getting to JSON creation/formatting, you created the JSON file but didn&#39;t actually <b>use</b> the JSON file. You copied the file&#39;s content into your HTML document, and only showed parsing a string to a json. Neglecting importing/requiring the JSON.&quot;, <br>    &quot;wouldRecommendVideo&quot;: true<br>  }, <br>}]<br><br>console.log(`${JSON[&quot;Youtube Video Analysis&quot;].rating} out of 10`) <br>// 9 out of 10<br><br>‚ù§Ô∏è Keep up the good work.
can someone explains me, why creating a json file and then copy its contents by hand to the script tag is in anyway useful...
great! thank you
I&#39;m learning how to write c# code at the moment and I had one task, where I had to work with a .json file. My god I tried to get my code to work for HOURS before I realized it was indeed a .json file and thought of checking how they work and how to use them. I now feel really really dumb :D. But thanks a lot for this great explanation of how they work!!!!

Nice explanation.
But you did not call the JSON file in the script? you literally coded it hard <br>How useful is creating the JSON file then and how do you read it in the code?

So what the use of it you can creat objects and arrys in js too and u did not even used json file u just copy pasted contents of it to html file im confiused

I love this video, thanks for that.<br>You listed advantages to using it and did a great demo. <br>But why would anyone actually create a json file? If you&#39;re creating a different file eg: the JS one that you created, what&#39;s the purpose of having a separate .json file? Why not just have everything in the JS one? Why have two?

Just an observation: Does it help to keep reinventing the wheel many times over. As soon as you have learnt Java, html, python, script, you are already behind the curve. I think it is not productive to keep coming up with newer tools and languages. Stick with the old tried and true. Thanks but no thanks.

Great video, and super simple. I am confused @WebDevSimplified why you copied over the contents of the JSON file. I understand the point that was made that it is just javascript and then to prove that point you copied it, but then the .json file seemingly appeared useless after that point was made and the video ended. It seems you proved the utility of JSON and then disproved the utility immediately at the end. I am just hoping for some clarification from you or anyone else in the comments. I am currently trying to take Javascript objects and write them in JSON to avoid build steps and that task is complicated to me, so I am trying to break it down to smaller problem domains.

This video promised to cover everything we need to know about JSON. It doesn&#39;t, instead it shows you rattling off code without explanation of form and function and at the end you have a half hearted application, based on your local server which has no bearing on anything in the real world.

I&#39;ve been making apps and fetching data from APIs but it was never clear to me what JSON really is, this video helped a lot. Thank you!
excellent presentation.  One mistake, you kept saying &quot;semi-colon&quot; when in fact it should be &quot;colon&quot;.

If I a make a JSON file to create a comic book or model API, is it a copywrite violations to scan covers and images for an image property?
I&#39;ve been picking things up here and there as I go but this is one of the best tutorials I&#39;ve seen. You did a great job of not focusing on the mistakes people commonly make (which just perpetuates those mistakes to future learners).

Very Useful , make some complex Structure Example
Bit of a necro here but perhaps someone will see it and be able to explain for me: What is the point of the JSON Object file? I know video is more than 3 years old so maybe the tech changed but I can skip the JSON.parse() method entirely and just access and print properties of the pasted objects as you would any other javascript object. I don&#39;t have to emulate a string and then parse. Did something change or are there advantages I am missing? <br><br>I know I still hear JSON mentioned a lot so I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m missing something obvious or key. Thanks to anyone who sees this and can offer feedback/guidance. &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: I just read about the advantage of JSON files for transmitting data and now see that they are more like a database file with specific formatting than a functional block of code. <br><br>So I can see why you&#39;d use them, but I&#39;m still confused as to why I can access and manipulate the object members without using JSON.parse(). Thanks again.

When converting the JSON into a string we use backticks instead of double or single quotes because you can only use backticks to create a multiline string.

Kid you should be a model in your spare time.
My question is, does JSON have to have the same keys for each object? so following your example, do you need CEO on the 2nd company even though it&#39;ll be filled with &quot;null&quot;?

Generally JSON is regarded as a hands-down better alternative over XML when there is no demand for things like XSL-based operations (or their logical equivalents employing different tech).  Now, truth be told, I am rusty on the whole XML bit, especially on the namespacing stuff, but it&#39;s my understanding that while JSON would nest oblects, XML would use referencing to point to other objects listed in the stream (perhaps to be received later) which, demands a more stream-oriented approach (processing an object before it&#39;s fully populated with external references), instead of going depth-first as in the example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=375">6:15</a>.  I understand that one COULD use the same approach in JSON, but the key difference is that XML leaves you no choice, and it&#39;s a good thing, imo.  Then there&#39;s a schema validation thing and XPath for data selection...  Am I missing something?  And if not, it would be nice if you could maybe give examples as to what scenarios would make XML preferable.  Thank you.

Great Tut..
It is a good practice to start the opening brackets on a new line so your eyes will not bleeding and both opening and closing brackets will be indented equally.<br><br>{<br>      &quot;key&quot;: value&quot;,<br><br>}
{<br>  &quot;invalidCustomNetwork&quot;: {<br>    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CLOSED&quot;,<br>    &quot;networkName&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;unconnectedAccount&quot;: {<br>    &quot;state&quot;: &quot;CLOSED&quot;<br>  },<br>  &quot;activeTab&quot;: {},<br>  &quot;metamask&quot;: {<br>    &quot;isInitialized&quot;: true,<br>    &quot;isUnlocked&quot;: true,<br>    &quot;isAccountMenuOpen&quot;: false,<br>    &quot;identities&quot;:<br><br>What is that mean true or false, or CLOSED , see above
Hi, great video, wat about using an app like Postman to validate json response by drilling down objects and object attributes? A big bunch of people struggle to do just dat and it seems like the perfect tutorial for you to make. Just my 2ct. Good job on the channel!

Thank you for this great video. Love how you show examples and your explanation is easy to follow and understand.  A friend sent me this video as I‚Äôm new to json.  Very grateful.
extremely helpful
So JSON is simply for storing data in a way that other languages can read?
I may missed the point, but if its in a seperate file, why copy it to the js file?
great

Awesome video, per usual. One question I had was what is the purpose of JSON? I realize in the video you reference its lightweight and easy to send back and forth because of its small file size, but I still am curious about JSON&#39;s main purpose. In my bootcamp many of our repos have a package.JSON with dependencies, scripts, etc.. Are these in a JSON file because they are easier to send back and forth or is there some other reason? What am I missing?
why do you blink so much
thank you
Great video
that was an incredibly concise and helpful video

I&#39;m not a programmer.<br>I&#39;m watching this video because I recently deleted my youtube channel but I wanted to save my playlists somehow, so I downloaded some files with the IDs of the videos I had in them.<br>Back in 2019, there was a fast trick to create a playlist by searching the IDs of several videos separated by commas, but it seems to no longer work.<br>I asked what to do and someone replied &quot;All you need is YouTube API&quot; but didn&#39;t explain shit. I&#39;m having a headache, but this video is so clear that I understood most of it, thanks a lot!

How to make the dynamic value as the key in nested JSON
Can you go over how you get yo hair like that
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to do an advanced JSON video, but I never really know the right way to import JSON files into my code. I know the readfile syntax is different in different languages, and even between Node.js vs. client-side js. It would be cool to see a walk through on best practices for that.
Thank you for your clear &amp; stunning explanation ! I‚Äôve found dozens info of json , but not until I took your lesson then I finally realize what json is ! Appreciate!
Great lesson.  Sorry I&#39;ll have to watch again because I fell asleep halfway.  Not your fault, I just walked 18 holes and well, I guess the fresh air did me good.
I still wonder what is secret to that hair style ü§î,
json has global variables that can be assigned to other properties and how?
the speed is just right
Nice hair.
This is a very good tutorial. It also increases the font size.
Very less information
Its was really useful, indeed, everything I needed to get my instance of a problem out of the ground!
I&#39;m a beginner making a game in Godot, i was trying to make an inventory system using a tutorial when the tutorial started using .json files, i was slightly scared i&#39;d have to learn another programming language, but thankfully this doesn&#39;t seem to complex, thanks

Hi Sir, how do I obtain a table that auto-populate. Meaning row could be added automatically.
Very useful since im new to JSON thank u web dev simplified for making this video
It would be more clear if you can add an example explaining how JSON acts as a translator between two programs or services;
i think this is the best video i saw that explains JSON.<br>great job<br>btw, i think that for very very simple data structures, an .INI file is even easier and simpler (but not widely spread, and not for the web, REST etc&#39;)
Hi, May I know what software you used to create the video for explaining the process of creating a JSON Object. And Great Tutorial Mate, Thanks for Sharing with us.

But have you heard of JSTAN (JavaScript Tabular Array Notation)?<br><br>Regular repeating JSON Array with space-wasting redundant field names:<br>[<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 1, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;One&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 2, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Two&quot;},<br> {&quot;id&quot; : 3, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Three&quot;}<br>]<br><br>The equivalent more compact JSTAN &quot;table&quot;:<br>[<br> [&quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;],<br> [1, &quot;One&quot;],<br> [2, &quot;Two&quot;],<br> [3, &quot;Three&quot;]<br>]<br><br>JSTAN is still valid JSON, just a more compact way of storing data from an array of non-hierarchical objects of the same type. You might call it a JSON <del>design pattern</del> storage pattern.
I think I understand, but what is the output. Can you give an example?
its 12 minutes
Thank you very much
Just the Video that I was looking Short &amp; Sweet
Me and my team are making a game with this!<br>Yes, a game! We learned the basics of JSON, i think we can do it! :D
I am new to coding and still confused after watching this video. It is still unclear to me what the difference between JS and JSON is (other than some syntax rules). in other words: what can JSON do that JS can&#39;t? I mean, the small syntax differences don&#39;t look relevant enough for me to care enough about JSON. Anyone has an answer? Thanks in advance.
Thanks for this, still struggling how to make an object dictionary iterable but this helped me learn the basics

Excelent. Thanks
Thank you
Your cute!!!
Is it compulsory for JSON to be wrapper aorund {}
I dont understand, why do you create the json file but then just copy and paste the content inside the same html file. Whats the point of the json file then and how do you call and show its information?
how to use nested json
At the end of all that, you still didn&#39;t explain why there is a need for JSON files if you are going to duplicate the same exact data in your JavaScript.  It would make more sense if you showed the Javascript pointing to the JSON file for the data.
Disclaimer: Don&#39;t use dates or undefined in JSON. Also, comments are not supported in JSON (please save us, we need information about our properties!).
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=287">4:47</a> colon*
there are people who simply have that something when it comes to teaching others, your ability to explain it to an idiot in 10 something minutes is a gem, do you have a course or something?
JSON is just fancy array
Gracias

Hello. Can I know how to add third company in the example you gave in the json file using python?
Great stuff, as usual. But please go a little slower. For those of us typing along it&#39;s sometimes hard to keep up. I imagine it&#39;s not necessary to copy and paste your JSON file into the HTML file, so a tutorial on including or embedding it would be helpful. Maybe you have one, I&#39;ll have to search.
u blink too much that i started blinking consciously
Just amazing dude

Your video is awesome. Adding to that you&#39;re freakin handsome ;)
Excellent video
What if I want to modify any values in JSON file/object, how do I do that?
Awesome
Not blinking is an illusion. And so is death XDXDXD
What&#39;s the point of the json file if you&#39;re just going to copy it&#39;s contents into the html file?  Would of been much more useful to end the video showing how that json file is used in a real world example.
Do you have a website?
This is the way all video tutorials should be.  Content is good.  Not only that, you explain things thoroughly, and enunciate very clearly.  And, in addition, you use a readable font size and contrast, so that I can read the code from across a room.  I&#39;m going to have to see what other videos you have.  I can only hope that you put out a lot more tutorial videos.
Thanks very clean up code.
My compliments to you! I&#39;m just following a course including JSON in the office but it is NOT as clear as you are! I thank you so much for your great job  in explaining so clearly such a concept.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> you called a colon a semi-colon. (edit) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> as well.

Easiest explanation of JSON on youtube
Crisp and Clear. Thank you
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=370">6:10</a>, if Kyle is Joey&#39;s friend, wouldn&#39;t it be repeated infinitely?<br><br>Kyle&#39;s friends value would include the Joey object, which would include the Kyle object, which would include the Joey object, and so on.
So wait- is a JSON file essentially a string literal?
Why do we need double quotes in JSON
I&#39;m just reviewing it again! I&#39;m starting to really understand it.
dude, you have a talent for teaching like no other. Not your first video I&#39;ve seen and not last. Great content

Hello Kyle~ can you make a video about dependent dropdown list in javascript and json? :)
&#39;&#39;comment&#39;&#39; : &#39;&#39;thank you for teaching me!&#39;&#39;
Kyle you are {&quot;TheKingOfCode&quot;,} or even &quot;Kode&quot; never before have I seen or heard such a clear and concise explanation of code of any kind, you got the gift. America is starving for talented teachers. You have just made a programmer out of me and that&#39;s not artificial intelligence, but a quantum leap for me after all these years. Thank you for sharing Kyle; &quot;King of Code&quot; or Kode.
I just wanted to learn this to make a Minecraft Java mod addon....
It is truly impressive that he didn&#39;t blink once in the video!
Very useful and to the point.  Thanks
You&#39;ve improved a lot since then, congrats
Why would you copy and paste the contents of the .json file to your .html file? Why create a .json file then? Isn&#39;t there a way to reference/import the .json information?
Thank you so much for this. The last part of the video was slightly confusing and I couldn‚Äôt see where you were clicking too. Please do another video just fully breaking down that last part. Also, when you were explaining the first part you used different brackets and on the second part you started off with the square brackets why is that?
Really great idea to tailor with JSON... reminds me a lot like .NET with Delegates (Patternization techniques with attributes that hold values). Thank you for showing!
you&#39;re a handsome programmer : )
doing this for mc
Thank you for the amazingly simple, yet thorough, explanation of JSON. I&#39;ve always wanted to learn it and you made it so simple. I&#39;ve always fine through my code of the current project I&#39;m working on to add JSON and it&#39;s amazing :)
This was so succinct, thank you
I learned something!
Excellent,Thanks. Request you to show how you record YouTube Videos.
I‚Äôm Json, so it‚Äôs you guys how‚Äôs been fucking about with me!
Somebody please explain to Kyle what a (semi)colon is!
Great tutorial

All hail to the Jason
So, if I understand correctly, classes in JSON can be compared to dicts in Python?
Very nice explanation subs
Can&#39;t you just call the index.html file using a function embedded in the Html file?<br>thanks again for the demonstration üëç
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=360">6:00</a> shouldn&#39;t `friends`&#39;s value be just an object? An array is redundant since the value is a single object.<br><br>Edit: JSON is a subset of JS not a superset<br><br>Edit2: how do you send JSON? How do you convert an object to JSON? How do you practically use it (get/post requests)? So much necessary information left out...

call me a bird bc imma nest so much with this knowledge
It was a very good and helpful video, but why should I create a .json file when I copy it over the my script anyways?
But why is json used? Did I miss something..
great explained! i like listen to you:)
Sir AApke paon kahan hai?? üòÉü§™
This is an awesome tutorial to start with JSON, As part of this tutorial, we can use an online tool to form JSON and understand,  For my Work, I am using <a href="https://jsonformatter.dev/">https://jsonformatter.dev</a> website

but can i add JSON  to HTML without putting whole string of JSON into HTML? like eg.  &lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; for javascript folder?<br>is there anything like &lt;script src=&#39;companies.JSON&#39;&gt;&lt;script&gt; ?
Why did he copy json data to HTML file while json file already had data?<br><br>Cannot access the data from .json file?
{<br><br>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,<br>&quot;age&quot; : 102,<br>&quot;address&quot;: &quot;DC&quot;,<br>&quot;subject&quot;:&quot;Json is easy and can be changed to list with loop in js &quot;,<br>&quot;continueMakingVideo&quot;: true<br><br>}

Can we connect the JSON file with the JS file instead of copy and pasting??
Including JSON.stringify would be more perfect. But the content is high quality üëçüëçüëçüòä
Very compact and succinct. (Y)
JSON is great way to transfer data specially while implementing APIs. Sometimes when you print JSON in logs, you see an unformatted string. I have found <a href="https://jsontoolbox.com/">https://jsontoolbox.com</a> to be a great way to format multiple such JSON on the same page.
thank you
be more specifique next time
Hello, do you have a video on how to configure the json API feature in the TP-LINK Archer MR200 router.  The target host is an Android mobile phone only
You look really young how old are you
I finally know what JSON is after nearly a year of coding :)
Thank you!
I&#39;m so glad JSON is used over XML.
How to deal with a nested array in JSON?
üëç
Clear explanation! You&#39;re really helping me out :-D
how does he get his json file to integrate with the html? i lose him at minute mark 9:28 and forward. any help would be appreciated, ty
Seems I already know most of this from minecraft :D
luv you man..
If we can do the same in Javascript then why we use JSON?
very nice explanation
Is JSON files some sort of DATA flat-file that is then access by JavaScript or some other application?
God damn json syntax is unintuitive and hard to read, are you kidding me. That friend array of users camouflages into pure ass, how are you supposed to keep track of where you are with that many lines of strings.<br> <br>It&#39;s a lot easier to grasp the separation of a new variable/object when the variable type has to be declared at the start, in other languages.
Thank you very much
This was great. In SEO,  we use JSON LD for Schema markup! This helped a lot!
If you just copy / pasted the info in the end, what was the point of the json file? Couldn&#39;t you have just keyed it into the html page to begin with? I&#39;m confused.
Excellent explantaion, thanks :)
why didn&#39;t you explained how to import data from the json file to js program?
you just made my day, you gave me a great idea how to solve my problem by creating an array of objects. thanks man
can I use json as a small database? and what are the advantages and disadvantages?
Thanks man, I will follow you videos for sure!!!
Overall, this video is very well done, but you mixed up the words colon : and semicolon ;.

I think the video was very good. I started JavaScript 1 month ago. I know some basics and with that video I catch the logic very fast. Continue the good work my friend
Please make a video on API‚Äôs how they work between front end and back end. Where does the Json , XML files used during API integration<br>Thanks in advance
the only helpful thing ive found on json files thank you sm
Thanks dude
Nice just learn what i needed
For me, it&#39;s better to put your JavaScript file below the body on the html. Because it&#39;s a different code  when you write it on javascript. And i&#39;m having a little bit of confusion. But other than that, I&#39;ve learned all of your videos &#39;til now.
one of the most confusing videos, i have seen ever
Great presentation. Thank you.
Thank you üëèüëè
why is this important why couldent you just make an object in js to begin with?
Was greatly insightful :&#39;)
Great video! I have one quibble though: you said &quot;semicolon&quot; instead of &quot;colon&quot; a couple of times. Just thought I&#39;d point this out as it may confuse some people.
i dont see the index.html

So nice to get that at the first go of learning
Is there any standardization for json response?
very well said, thanks for the tutorial. question, hm do you have or are you going to create a tutorial on how to use JSON in sending and receiving data to and from an API. cheers
This video should be in Top 10 Anime Betrayals bc it titled learn JSON in 10 minute, but is 12 minute? long? Author explain. am v confusion

That was very efficient and effective. Thank you sir!
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> and twenty seconds later, you called a colon a semicolon.

What if the value is a function
this is great for me, I&#39;m not a developer but you explained it perfectly.
Thanks for creating this informative and easy to follow tutorial.  I am new to JSON.  Can you please tell me what program you are using to write this code in?
Why is it necessary to convert the JSON to a string within the HTML?
Thanks man.
I noticed in the example u gave that the objects were closed in a boxed bracket but I thought a json code is encompassed in a curvy bracket. Please can you elaborate?  Thank you

Why is the key value enclosed in quotes?  What information is added that simply interpreting anything to the left of a colon as a key.  The quotes just seem to be unnecessary extra typing.

Hi, is there any chance you could help me with some basic JSON for Sharepoint conditional formating?
You keep saying semicolon when you mean colon. (Semi colon ;  colon : ). It‚Äôs very important for correct syntax.
Very clear and concise. Thank you so much and congratulations for your video.

Your videos are easy to understand
simply simple, thanks!!!
I perfectly agree with @Marsh Wetland: Perfect pacing and explanation! Thank you! Just one question: what&#39;s the difference between console.log(companies) and console.log(JSON.parse(companies))? Didn&#39;t you say that JS understands JSON by itself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=570">9:30</a>), so why parsing?
Excellent presentation. Thanks for sharing

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> that&#39;s a colon.
I prefer JSON over YAML. JSON is easier to read!
This is the best video I have came across till now on JSON. Thanks mate.
For the first time I actually understand what is JSON is .. thank you üòä. Can you please do some tutorials on Creating API&#39;s to download data from web??
is it possible to get key by passing a value in JSON <br><br>for Eg:<br>{ &quot;id&quot; : [ {&quot;1&quot;:&quot;abcd&quot;},<br>             {&quot;2&quot;:&quot;efgh&quot;} ] }<br><br>enter &quot;abcd&quot;<br>and get 1 as output
Around 4.40 you kept saying semi-colon instead of colon; other than that which was confusing, it was a very good instroduction to JSON
Hi Kyle, Thank you for the time spent making this video only to share it for free.<br><br>I want to make a clarification - first I am a beginner developer. Do we have any significant difference between json created for use in a JS program with those created to be used with other programming languages (In my own case, python)?<br><br>Here is an example of my iteration:<br><br>{<br>&quot;name&quot;: [&quot;Emmanuel&quot;], <br>&quot;age&quot;: [23],<br>&quot;gender&quot;: [&quot;male&#39;]<br>}<br>Will this work if I call it using say JS?

Excellent video thank you. I have a very basic question: why write the CEO of Small Business null instead of an empty string? Is there any advantage to having null?
awesome
Very Useful
Short yet on point. Thanks man.
Why did u say JSON is lightweight, I made a comparison to CSV, JSON is like 3 times more of the file size of CSV.
Help helpful. Kindly consider making a short video on API
thx so much!
thanks man

in JSON first need start from { } and only then you can use array []

Hi, I just found your videos and I like them a lot! <br>I&#39;m having trouble moving JSON data (that I receive from an API) from my server to a separate JS file (on the frontend) where I have functions set-up to process it and display the parts I want in my HTML. I thought this project would be a fairly simple Express App, but I&#39;m totally lost right now. I watched your middleware video, so I&#39;ll tinker some more and see what I can figure out...<br>Thanks for making videos!!
Thank you for video. Very helpful üëçüèª
wouldn&#39;t you want your html document to use the actual .json file instead of embedding the same code you could have simply written into your javascript.  In short, shouldn&#39;t you have shown us how to embed the .json file or am I missing something?
Am I the only one who couldn&#39;t get over the inverted opening double-quotes in &quot;hobbies&quot;? Other than that, a very informative video - great content!
Thank you bro, that really helped a lot.
Hi Kyle, thank you for the video! Liked and subscribed!<br>I hope you could help me out, I have a PHP file with JSON in it and it&#39;s working well.<br>But the JSON code is a mess so when I try to make it prettier using some tools to add new data to it, it loses functionality.<br>Befoire: var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{&quot;square&quot;:{&quot;silver&quot;:{&quot;100x100&quot;:{&quot;squareFull&quot;:{&quot;PRODUCT&quot;:&quot;261&quot;,&quot;SKU&quot;:1732, THIS IS WORKING<br>After:     var calcTree = JSON.parse(&#39;{<br>  &quot;square&quot;: {<br>    &quot;silver&quot;: {<br>      &quot;100x100&quot;: {<br>        &quot;squareFull&quot;: {<br>          &quot;PRODUCT&quot;: &quot;261&quot;,<br>          &quot;SKU&quot;: 1732,<br>          &quot;PRICE&quot;: 60.45,<br>          &quot;OLD_PRICE&quot;: &quot;65.00&quot;,<br>          &quot;URL&quot;: &quot;/catalog/zerkalnaya_plitka/zerkalnaya_plitka_kvadrat/serebryanaya_kvadratnaya_zerkalnaya_plitka/?oid=1732&quot;<br>        } This is not working
Great tutorial! But what I was missing: what about dates (and timestamps)?
I know I&#39;m a bit late but instead of copying the json into the js, how would you simply make a variable with the content of the json file? As a dummy example that wouldn&#39;t actually work: let variable = file(name.json).content
Very useful video, thanks!

I need to convert the json file into dataframe using python or r.
How to read this type of dataset in python?. Because i have the same type of dataset having object dictionary and list all those things.
Why build the file if all you are going to do is cut and paste it?<br>Isn&#39;t there some sort of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include">#include</a>?<br><br>Why put it in quotes when all you are going to do is parse it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=542">9:02</a> but... what is the point of the companies.json-file that you created, when you&#39;re just copying and pasting from it? You could have just declared it in your html-file to begin with üßêWhy did you make a .json-file?
Thank you for the information, its useful
This was a fantastic explanation, thank you so much!
thank you!
Good but it‚Äôs a Colin : not a semicolon ;
How do you read a JSON file from another HTML file, as you did in the video, but without copying and pasting the code? something like export/import?
Please correct me if I am wrong, but to leave notes in your script, use &lt;/item&gt;?
Simply thank you very much

If you forget those double quotes for keys, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time.
super
Maybe I just missed the point. Why didn‚Äôt you just type all the json code in JS at first place but instead of a separate json file then copy from it? The json file should be imported, right?
Thank u for explaining so well
wow, is very simple to understand what you explain and know how to work with JSON.
So you copied the whole json file to that html file, so what&#39;s the purpose to create a json file when you can write all of that in the html file?
&quot;And in the next course, we&#39;ll talk about the difference between colon &amp; semi-colon ...&quot;
What‚Äôs the point of json?
I don&#39;t get it... Why would you type code in a json file just to copy/paste it?  How do you access the code that&#39;s on the json file?
An error occurred =&gt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
Who is Jason?
i cant emulate my code some help please?
No,I learned JSON at 12 minute
I like your JSON  Video, one of the best.
Thanks for making this understandable.
I had a couple questions, instead of copying and pasting the code from the JSON file, are you able to just call the other file that you had already created? If you can&#39;t call the initial JSON file you had created, why even create the file? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to just code in the html file from beginning?
Can I get your mail please? üòä
Very clear and informative, Thanks!!
thanx
this isnt 10minutes this is 11 minutes
Nice! Thanks so much!!
Great video. I think this is the best tutorial I have seen about JSON. Thank you very much.
Excellent video. Congratulations!,
Could you please do a tutorial on password resets with the passwords declared in JSON file(I now know how to do that from this vid) but linked to JS file and how to call it on the html :) <br>also, with my html my on click or oj-on-action does not want to work but i have done so much research and still struggling<br>Thank you, any help will be greatly appreciated
Just keep it up bro....It was really json in 10 mins.. Thanks
Super Simple and Fast Explanation
I have a simple question . when you are copying all the data from json file into the main html portion (script) then what is the use of creating Json file at all???????????. you should demonstrate to link the json file and then use the data inside of it using javascript . Ans me anyone
It was very good videos in a very easy way. I&#39;m also a teacher but I have good very good grip on PHP. Want to work on python too so Can u make a video on python with web development?? Without using any framework like flask Or something. Just like PHP. We write our script file without any special software and for e.g. anaconda üêç. Your response will be appreciable for me. Thank you.
Very nice üëç
Your explanation is so good
Watch at 2x and learn JSON in 6 minutes üòÇ
Explaining JSON in 10 minutes &quot;simplified&quot; is even more elongated than it takes to explain it in depth and formally at a university xd. Also calling JSON as a &quot;superset of Javascript&quot; is simply a fale statement, lol.
Actually, they&#39;re not semi-colons. They are colons - two dots. Semi-colons have dot and comma.
You lied it&#39;s 12 minutes not 10
Indeed this is Web Dev Simplified. Keep up the good work.
Very well explained.  To the point, and just what I needed :)
I want to like this video twice
So what about data?
json.parse i just parsed this comment
I cant thank you enough for making these quick guides man. Ure an hero!
Nice video! Well explained the concept
You keep referrening : as semicolon or double colon. It&#39;s just colon.
Very clearly explained, I am grateful for your tutorials, thanks mate!
Thank you, brother. <br>From Bangladesh üáßüá©
Hey, is there away to assign a file to an &quot;input&quot; like a &quot;word or excel&quot; in html and then read the contents  from js? The thing is,  i want the file to automatically be select and when i press a button it reads the info.
very good video.
So can I put down on my Resume that I know JSON now?
Great. Super easy to understand! Thanks you.
java script please
Cover AVRO format pls
Dude, you keep saying semi-colon. A semi-colon is a ;   you mean colon, which is :

Thank you sir
I just saw my first video about JSON and don&#39;t get the big-deal of it. If it is just to store data, I could store it in any form (txt file, in a database, etc). What&#39;s the point of JSON? Where is its power?

GREAT video
nice video. helpful.
I thought JSON was like a new programming language but just an installment of JavaScript like React and jQuery.<br><br>Also what is the purpose of JSON.stringify?
Very nice. Do we need to convert json to base 64 string before sending over the internet?
I guess this is also good to learn for minecraft commands?
Thanks. This video was very useful to me. It helps me understand the nic concept of JSON.
thank you very much this was so helpfull  , &lt;3
Awesome tutorial. Thank you sir!
Please edit audio wherever you have said semicolon but meant a colon.
Áõõ‰∏ñÁæéÈ¢úÔºÅ
Niice one
; semi colon<br>: colon<br><br>Good video though!
great video thanks for the simple explanation really helps break it down nice and simple, quick question can different objects have different number of properties, like in your companies example let&#39;s say big cooperation has name, numOfEmployees, ceo, rating but second element in array json object small start up has 6 properties lets say numOfBranches and something else?
<b>Visible_happiness.json</b>
Thanks man..
What avout two way relations? For example friends.‚Äã A friend with B.‚Äã The JSON of A has an array of all of his friends. Contained is of course the JSON of B. But the JSON of B also has an array with all of his friends. Contained is the JSON of A and so. How does this work?
You handsome
It&#39;s a colon, not a semicolon

am i the only one that realized that he blinked for the first time in an intro?
hey web dev simplified would you mind answering one of my silly questions related to python? please let me know thanks!
: is a colon and not semi colon..
Thank you, that was super interesting
So in simple words JSON is like classes and objects of C++
sir blinks alot.

Excellent
why is he so cute
Nice Job!!! Just started learning JSON. Glad I find this video first.
Loved this video! Do you have a video covering what a beginner should use to write JSON? Also, how to apply it to real life applications?
anything in JSON is valid JS.. so what`s the point of JSON.parse when you already had access to that JSON before that? (i guess that`s just an example to show both ways ?) . I`m assuming you use JSON.parse only when you make an api request and get your JSON as a string and not as an array.  Please correct me if I`m wrong
Hi Kyle
Thank you!
Excellent tutorial! Clear content and quick presentation. Good job.
not semi-colon between k-v pairs.  full colon.
The way of the presentation of the contents in each of your videos is really good. Thank you for these great tutorials. I have a request if possible- do you have the plan to make some videos related to programming. For example, Algorithm and Data Structures etc. and how they can be practically used in Web Development (if needed).<br>Thanks again. :)
Hi bro, hope you doing great!<br>I really don&#39;t have much idea about Json, but you gave me what I am looking for, thank you so much your clear and easy to catch about Json, keep it up bro<br>Thanks again!<br>Anthony
I really enjoyed this quick start JSON tutorial. You are very clear and provided enough info that i can write my own. Thank you
I just understand 20% when you talk because i&#39;m my english not well , but I focus this video i can more understand about Json, Thank you so much.
Have been following now am becoming an expert in JS... Thanks buddy I need your contact.
you mean colon not semicolon
Great video, thank you!
love your video very very sensible thanks keep up on this
Great video for a starter like me, i wanted to see how you can call a json data file within the executable script to be read as an input file (not copy/pasting the whole content), how easy is that?
Simple and crisp information, Thanx bud
Learn JSON in 12 minutes lol. Great vid!
My questions (I am new to programming):<br><br>1. Consider those values in JSON need to get from database, what can we write in order to loop all the data from database before putting into html to be used?<br><br>2. Then, how do we link the JSON file to html without have to copy all the things in JSON to script first like you did in the video? (Can we put a variable in html and let JSON return to them?)
Can we add conditional statement within JSON data?
Awesome, thanks!
&quot;That was awesome ! ! ! thanks&quot;
Simple and good video
Thanks for the video. Your introduction to the JSON topic was paced and complete. It really helped get me started. Nice work.
With my most recent exposure to programming/code of any kind having been an intro to C, this feels like dark witchery. Code that doesn&#39;t care what type your inputs are - wow, imagine that.
Wow. Nicely explained. Thank you so much! üëçüèº
You did a wonderful job Kyle of giving a clear, succinct and thorough explanation of JSON.<br>I will definitely be coming back for more tutorials from you.
Great explaination man üôå
Thank you.
Well done
Awesome
Kyle, your hair and eyebrows are really nice üëå
Great job! I need help getting json code into WordPress html block.

Damn, dude, are you a model or something?
I think JavaScript is superset of JSON
Outstanding video.  My only comment is to let you know that the &quot;:&quot; is a colon, not a semicolon.  The semicolon contains a comma as in &quot;;&quot;.  Best regards. :-)
What kind of keyboard do you use? It sounds so good.
Excelent tutorial. Right to the point, clear and perfect speed to follow and understand what you are doing. Subscribed!
Wow, thank you! It was so hard  to understand how json and parsing works. I have been looking at guides that were too confusing!
Subscribed after one minute of your video. Thanks alot for great content üëçüëç
good
how you do the live refresh? I mean you save it and the console refreshes directly.
Great tutorial ! Thanks for sharing
Quality content, mate, thanks for this one.<br>I&#39;m at a new job dealing with APIs, and your content is just what I was looking for to understand JSON better.<br>Liked and subscribed, keep up the good work.
Excellent tutorial
This is an incredible video! I feel better now that I have an understanding of JSON and all this in just 12 minutes. If others were to teach me, Half-Life 3 Episode 4 would have been released, and I still wouldn&#39;t have gotten a thing.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=590">9:50</a> you added the apostrophe &#39; , and made it in to string. How you do that? Is that somehow possible in the PhpStorm?
JSON is my street name.
Apologies if this is stupid question, but why do we need the JSON file if we just paste its contents into the HTML? Is there another way to get the JSON data without pasting?
Could u plz show how make selection click in html page and select json file and load json data and display json data in HTML page in format table.
Thanks man, cleared up some things very nicely, very informative
Thanks you&#39;re a life saver.
I&#39;m new at this but at the end, wouldn&#39;t it be:  ((companies)[0].name)    instead of (companies)[0].name)    (I added an extra paren at the beginning) or is it actually the way you stated?
Rather than surrounding the JSON by ` backticks , can we not give the user the object value of the JSON as he will still have an option to JSON.stringify it. And most of the times, the user may require the object of JSON instead of the string
Hey thank you for the video.  I want to be an exceptional programmer and these are very helpful videos to learn different coding languages. Much appreciated.
Thank you so much sir! I am in the process of becoming Azure certified and i really wanted to iron-clad my understanding of ARM templates which are written in JSON format. This video was a wonderful explanantion of the creation and syntax used in such files. Thanks alot bro!
hi,i have a question ,what is diffence:<br> [{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}] <br>and<br> {&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}
God bless you bro !..
In the example user.json for hobbies is the double quotation correct?(both closing double quote)<br>And the array element for &quot;hobbies&quot; i.e. &quot;weight lifting&quot; have you used the correct
Informative !
So basically the JSON objects are dictionaries.
Hmm, You do realise there are occasions where you say &#39;semicolon&#39; when in fact you mean &#39;colon&#39;?   I started noticing it in the 4th minute.
just a quick question <br>why did you use [ ] first ???<br>I thought we use { } to open and close
It supports bouillon? What about consomm√©?

Start to finish, coding a rest API from Corvid
How do you import the json file in the JS file instead of copy pasting the entire json code? Not sure I followed that part
Thanks
Sorry if I missed something, but whats the point in this double thing you did?<br>I removed the backticks and also I removed the JSON.parse and  inner parenthesis and it works just fine.<br>Any reason they must be added? Thanks for gr8 video!
Hi folks, maybe this is a stupid question but when we insert JSON inside of an HTML document do we have to copy all JSON lines of code inside of HTML or there is a shorter way to work on it?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=325">5:25</a> why you wrote &quot;Hobbies&quot; with same double quotes both sides ... is that a mistake by you???
could you pls make a video about &quot;implicit grant flow&quot; and how to implement it?
So what was the json file for? Didn&#39;t look like you needed it at all. You just put everything you wrote in the json file in the script tag. This doesn&#39;t really show or explain what json is even for. You didn&#39;t even use the json file for anything. I am very confused.
He&#39;s too pretty for me to focus on the topic....
One thing that I‚Äôd change about JSON... allow trailing commas in lists.  So many times I‚Äôve forgotten to sort out the commas when adding/removing/swapping lines in JSON files, and then spent time wondering why my code‚Äôs not working.  And, I‚Äôm not keen on all those quotes either... seriously, why do key names need to be quoted?
great video, thanks!
{<br>&quot;good&quot;: &quot;yes&quot;<br>}
That&#39;s 10 minutes in base 12...
It&#39;s a colon, not a semi colon.
Is this doable with Python aswell?
Cool My Friend
What compiler or ide is this?
You really cleared up all the confusion I had, thanks man üôèüôè
Brilliant!! Your work is impeccable. So easy hands on to JSON for dummies. Good :)
What is the best tool freely available to for Json and python?
Great video and Thank you!

Hey can you create a javascript program that is able to save, search, view, update and delete a data to and from a database table and should use JSON object or Javascript object in passing and receiving data???
Hey bro how do I make it so that VS code underlines my mistakes (if I make any)? Thank you.
Thanks Mate. it was really helpful to me in understanding JSON basics
Really good tutorial, only 1 minor thing. <br>In the end you say you can do anything with the newly passed JSON object that you can do with a normal javascript object.<br>There is no &quot;JSON Object&quot;. The JSON has been parsed from a String to an Object so calling it a JSON Object is incorrect, it&#39;s just an Object :)
it helped
HOW AMAZING !! I Love it excellent explanation <br>Thanks so much
Noob question: please explain in detail how to make output go to console as in the video.  Great explanation of json. I just had trouble following along in vs code cause console did not show results

Why would you build a companies.json file just to copy/paste its content into your index.html file? Why not let the &#39;companies&#39; variable in index.html equal the companies.json file (or &quot;JSON.stringify(companies.json)&quot; assuming that&#39;s indeed a real method)?

This was super helpful and clear, thank you so much!
Very nice and informative. Thanks
Thanks !!!
Really simple and straight forward - much appreciated
Thanks so much. Happy Coding :)
Thanks, just the information I needed to get started on a project using JSON data
I feel was feeling a bit intimidated by JSON, but you explained it really well and it makes much more sense now. Thanks!
Great little video! Nice job üòÄ

Your explanation was as cool as your look! <br>Hats Off Bro!
The simplicity of the explanation is mind blowing. Great video üëç
How you made the animations text?
Thanks for this. But I have a question. Wouldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t we call the json file rather than copying what&#39;s in the file in our html? seems redundant to have a file... Or am I missing something?

Love this ,Simple and effective.....I am so observed  that at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=340">5:40</a> a confused quote at &quot;hobbies&quot;...just a thing üòú
Thanks for the video, but it&#39;s not a &quot;semi-colon&quot;.
Nice tutorial, but how do you let a variable equal to a JSON file content without manually copying and pasting?
Smooth Explanation....Now i know how to use JSON as a tester ..5 star for you
Thank you
Beautiful Way of explaining, So easy to follow and understand, and matters are spot on instantly. Kindly do more a systematic tutorial for Kotlin too. Thank you
You are great dude, this is the first video of your&#39;s I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m Subscribed!
wait a second. Why did you create a .JSON file if you just pasted the entire file into your html file? lol what was the point of having the .JSON file?
If you haven&#39;t already, please do an in-depth video on using Axios.get/put/post/patch/ etc . I&#39;m simply lost when it comes to referring to the DOM and trying to update the page using a database. :(
I cannot tell you how much I truly appreciate how you break everything down into bite-sized pieces of information! I felt such a wave of relief after watching this video. Seriously.

Besides confusing a colon with a semicolon this was an excellent tutorial. Thanks for sharing
Thanks for helping me hack pvz2 lmao
Thanks!
Thanks for the great tutorial!! Quick question - how do you write JavaScript code to read the data in the JSON file and store that info in a variable? :D
I don&#39;t know any programming. YouTube randomly recommended it. But I feel I learned something. Thank you.
Thank you.for clarifying this subject. I honestly feel as if I can understand how to use Json now. I do have a question. How do I rename a txt file to json so that roku will read it for direct publishing?
A tutorial on JSON? I find it odd but great video nevertheless.
can you make a video about consuming API with Fetch. please.
i can&#39;t than you enough .<br>you man is amazing.<br>you are my go to guy when i try to learn something complicated.<br>even though i am 2 min into the video<br>but i know i will understand in the end.<br>after the Promise video.<br>i trust you <br>thanks a lot &lt;3.
Awesome lecture!!

wow...thanks bro.... :)
If you&#39;re familiar with python JSON is a list of dictionaries, more commonly known as a hash map. One of the most efficient data structures that&#39;s used commonly to make fast code.
Thank you!

Thanks for the video. Trying to learn json and coffeescript before moving on to action cable for my rails development üòä
U copy pasted JSON DATA INTO JS but you didn&#39;t show how use json directly from file.Json
You are calling colon a semicolon?
Absolutely to the point !!!
watch in 1.25x speed. thank me later
Hi, Could you please share a video where we can create a JSON file using JavaScript and place at given path?
Thanks for being noob friendly LOL the best way to learn things is simply taking it from the beginning üåºüåºüåº /eva
Bad tutorial
very helpful. Thanks mate
I can&#39;t thank you enough. I was stuck with understanding both the idea and syntax with JSON until now. Thank you.
Quite informative!   PS: That&#39;s colon in the JSON not semicolon ... just a feedback. thaks
Thanks this helped, title is not click bait.
You start with saying that Json is stored in a separate Json file but then you copy it to a JavaScript file with no explanation on why you did this. I was thinking you were going to access the json file directly.
You have no idea how you&#39;ve helped. Thank you!<br>Subscribed.
It&#39;s beautifully presented.
Thanks very much!  Very helpful!
So clear and easy to follow. Thank you!
Thanks Mate! Love from India!!
A really great vid, except the &quot;all you need to know&quot; comment at the end which isn&#39;t correct. Anyway, thank you, a very useful pace and style. Please get a Patreon account.
What about with the other languages?
This is by far, the best!!
nobody:<br>Kyle: &quot;I like lifting weights.&quot;
great video. tks
Sorry not a pro here I&#39;m just starting out in programming, but could you please elaborate more on the uses of JSON ? I don&#39;t see why is it so significant the fact that it can be realized with OOP concept in most languages. Also, isn&#39;t it more efficient to store data in a database and manipulate them with SQL ? Thanks in advanced.
Thank you Sir
Solved One Of the  biggest doubt between json and objects. Thank you :-)
Ir kyle is joeys friend... wouldnt it end up in an infinite nesting issue?
Isn&#39;t it colon after Key? You&#39;ve been saying semi-colon. Its confusing!
Why is he keep blinking?
Is there a way to NOT copy and paste the entire json code into the script tag?
Instead of null, we should consider using a null value representation such as  -1 or even -1000,  some value that will display safely. So as to reduce headache for users who consume the json data!
This is really simpler than most JSON explanation I could find on the internet. You&#39;re doing great. Keep it up, bro!
Can you please do a video of &quot;How to integrate SQL code with JSON in 10 minutes&quot;? thx
I think I&#39;ve seen you before. I just can&#39;t remember where . . .
Awesome one
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=565">9:25</a> how do i check that out in my browser
to the point and clear thank you! please keep these videos coming!
How do you read the json array from the file to achieve the same result without manually copying the information from &quot;user.json&quot; to the &quot;index.html&quot; file?
One tip: Don&#39;t start object keys names with number ;-)
Good One
If you want to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string that can be passed to a server then use let variableName = JSON.stringify(yourObject);
Your tutorials are world class but are you doing some sort of code with your blinking?
Keep making these awesome videos
Right ... Learn in 10 and forget in 7. We have to stop this tree of domination! Let&#39;s meet at 9 I&#39;ll give instructions for everybody. We&#39;ll swing the boat and fly away at speeds of 1 and 2. I&#39;ve noticed one thing... If I get paid well - I never forget things.
Good video. However. JSON is a subset of javascript not a superset. Also even to that there are exceptions. <a href="http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset">http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset</a>
Thank you.
Enjoyed it. Thanks
Your explanation is so clear and rightly paced. Thanks!
it&#39;s possible for 5 minutes or less if you make it for those who know javascript already. but for beginners, this 10 minutes wouldn&#39;t be enough. As I have known js for a long time, this is simplest explanation for json but a little too long.
Hi.Iam from India <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tq">#Tq</a>

Ur explaination is good and aslo pronounced
Simply awesome man , thank you !!
[{&quot;satisfaction_level&quot;: &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;: &quot;thanks mate, this was really useful&quot;}]
angularjs videos definitely would be great in your playlist.<br><br>btw nicely explained
Wow. Good articulation with nice voice.
wow, it&#39;s like shortest clip of complete tutorial
you are not using semi-colons but colons!
if the whole JSON text is copied in the script what is the need of JSON file and how to use it in script
Good tutorial, I understand all in one go. well explained in such a simple way.  Thanks
Just a perfect tutorial. Exactly how it should be done. Subscribed!
Great. Hey, I&#39;m stuck with parsing a nested json file in my python program. How to parse a nested json file?
Molto interessante!
good information.  tq
&quot;SUCH&quot; a great tutorial. Many thanks
Great JSON video! By the way, which font are you using in the video?
your videos are so helpful. God Bless u dude. can u make a video on how to use json, js,  and html to  pull data from  the json and put it  in the html webpage in a textbox or show how to pull information from a webpage  user  inputing text into a textbox into the json file.
You cleared all dark corners about JSON but when you started about Javascript and JSON man I lost the stream like a power failure. :( <br><br>But that&#39;s ok. I only wanted the JSON part. :)
You speak with just the right speed and clarity! BeautifulÔºÅ
Thank you for this tutorial ... Really great
i&#39;m literally just here cuz i want to create Minecraft bedrock mods because a new modding update is coming out and need to learn the basics lol.
you said &#39;semi-colon&#39; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=268">4:28</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=288">4:48</a> ... is that a mistake or a &#39;semi-colon&#39; works as well as &#39;colon&#39;?
Hey are you the guy from coralfish12g?? Coz you both look identical
I still don&#39;t understand you literally just created a JS object, so what is JSON and why would you use it?
talk about simplicity... couldn&#39;t be more simplified
And yeah. You&#39;re beautiful
Thank You Sir.<br>I fully understand it.<br>Thanks again.
Perfect pacing and explanation. I just wonder at the diversity or randomness of your double quote marks, e.g. at time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=348">5:48</a>. I guess it&#39;s just an artifact of your font, but it really threw me.
I think you said that backwards: wouldn‚Äôt it be more accurate to say JS is a superset of JSON? And logically, only a subset would seem to guarantee compatiblity, a superset would by definition have things they subset doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just being pedantic, I guess.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,  you sir have achieved that. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thumbsup">#thumbsUp</a>
Thanks, man.  You know, I&#39;ve been studying web dev between working my 2 jobs, and after hearing people mention JSON more times than I can count, only found out what it was for about a week ago.  Appreciate you providing this brief explanation.
Well done !...Thank you for taking the time to produce such informative and to the point presentations. You have a new subscriber !
You keep calling &quot;colon&quot; a &quot;semi-colon&quot;
Really easy to understand and well-explained video. Much more helpful than reading old university slides, haha.
Does it work the same way in vs code for c++?
it&#39;s impressive how you the ideas were one by one and smooth to grasp, however on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM&amp;t=160">2:40</a> the type you call objects, isn&#39;t it a map? Since in java it&#39;s called like that!
So backticks instead of stringify???
Good Explanation

I expected to learn how to write a JSONpath of a JSON field.
That&#39;s not semicolon. It&#39;s just colon.

I am neither a programmer or developer, but have been hacked by one! PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME!! I have a hard time describing what&#39;s goin on to other people who don&#39;t understand this type of thing, so basically they think I&#39;m crazy..I&#39;m so sorry for asking for your help! I know that you have more important things in life to worry about, but this is almost to the point of destroying mine :(
throwback to the old windows. Great video!

Would love if you made a Tutorial on jQuery!
Great video, really helpful
I always thought that a JSON file had to begin with curly brackets, but I see you using regular brackets in the demo. What&#39;s the rule here for the start of a JSON file?
Really well done and organised üëçü§ì
That was such a professionally styled tutorial video! You got full control over what you&#39;re gonna go through and you present with simple examples! It has not been often I&#39;ve seen performance like this on a channel of this size. You deserve to be much bigger, and I hope many more people will get to see this and benefit from it! Keep it up!
I hope you all enjoyed this quick video on JSON. If you have any topics you want me to cover in future videos let me know!
