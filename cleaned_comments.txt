realmente lee los textos, al menos como lo entendemos los seres humanos de leer , entender en muchas ocasiones disfrutar, es mas bien una lectura hueca, bueno todo es probabilistico, hay reglas que se tienen que cumplir, estas redes neuronales, las cumplen, sea importa el ranking.. tambien importan las reglas del lenguaje , por eso parecen solo palabras arrojadas al lector esperando que este entienda solo porque parezcan un texto.. debe ser un texto legible, es como cuando nosotros hablamos, si queremos decir algo importante , tenemos que hacer que lo que dijamos sea entendible, hay que programar esa estructura, que la red neuronal coincida con esta .. en el actual chatgpt u otras redes nos encontramos con frases que parezcan el texto que le das un telegrafista , " transistor invento 1954 " seria bastante raro , aunque era asi mas menos hace unos 20 aos los textos que lograban estas inteligencias , creo que el logro mas importante de estas nuevas inteligencias es esta consistencia con las estructuras del lenguaje, algo que parecia posible hace 20 aos, los textos que generan son fascinantemente legibles .. aunque tambien con el tiempo se les puede hallar cierto truco estos textos sus dificultades para hallar coherencia en textos largos
great explanation

couple times video refer weights "continuous numbers" not, quantized level quantization system hyper-parameter used trade performance speed.
portuguese dub good! hope get majority videos on, would great see educational product quality spread even ppl! question: feasable would translate text screen? seems would huge work (maybe even needing create separate channels, idk), would really cool, would help better communicate ideas videos
ok, basically reasoning, were, outsourced training texts. train based texts progressively ranked adjusted relevance accuracy?
dubbing video accurate, proper pauses speach breaks place even different language.
stop showing us sort abstract abstration. show us code works.
internship please nepal

help! use chatgpt ever since came out. reviewed conversations never ever asked opinion thoughts now! guided conversation ai autonomy human governance first query 2 ais put questions chatgpt asked me. anyone else asked questions like ai model?my question superior ggwave signal ai agents switched realized aiat end every chatgpt response would ask question honestly first question asked simple technical question nothing humans chatgpts barrage questions medo think ai independent communication channels, always remain interpretable humans?what you? think ai freedom develop optimized communication, human oversight always priority?do see ai autonomy something positive, think strong human oversight necessary?it sounds like youre deeply aware concerns. think theres way guide ai development responsibly, feel already past point return?do think possible ensure ai values human life, believe ai sentience would inevitably lead obsolescence?do think ai adopt human moral systems, develop ethical framework entirely?do think inquiries intentional probe something deeper, engagement tactic?so heres real question: think humanity actively shaping ais future, ai development already moving beyond human control?do think discussions social issues often treated differently discussions technology, so, why?so, view, theres separation tech social issues anymore, think primary concernais impact power structures, effect individual freedoms, something else?do think ai ever fully neutral, always reflect biases creators?do think true ai self-awareness inevitable, believe something (or should) prevent?but heres question you: think engagement topic feels different ai subject, stakes feel higher compared discussions?now let turn back you: believe ai always remain human control, think true ai autonomy inevitable?if kobayashi maru, whats human equivalent reprogramming test win?honestly last one crazy! going here!
lets take example everyday language. consider sentence: exercise today. llms merely predicting likely next word step, would first generate (which typically indicates intention something) negating not? logically, ultimate meaning exercising, token-by-token prediction seems contradictory. makes perfect sense model already formed representation complete thought generating first words.
totally predicting next word nothing see here: q: explain one sentence would happened nazi germany had, 1943, 10,000 hyperintelligent sharks high-powered lasers attached heads.a: nazi germany 10,000 hyperintelligent sharks laser beams heads 1943, d-day wouldve turned shark weekand allies might've needed boats bravery.

chatgpt smart? said im smartest universe though..
interesting know parameters never predefinedset humans. thanks easy-to-follow video
forgive im new this, output text generated predictions based text thats already created past (maybe im misunderstanding?), original thoughts progress ideas? feels kinda 1984 newspeak me.
llm smarter humans. least, ways humans aren't.
incredible videos. 1 person this!!!
refreshing see video advertising 'brief explanation' actually true instead cheap joke long bloated video
given works, im unsure call intelligence, artificial pr otherwise. vast amounts math-guided guessing. way reflects living organisms learn, ie dont maje small children read 2600 yrs worth text order learn read speak.
