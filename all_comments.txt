I&#39;m a big fan even when sometimes I honestly don&#39;t understand a few videos
This is one of the greatest videos I have seen on this.  Really helped me understand how LLM&#39;s work.

realmente no lee los textos, no al menos como lo entendemos los seres humanos de leer , entender y en muchas ocasiones disfrutar, es mas bien una lectura hueca,  y bueno no todo es probabilistico, hay reglas que se tienen que cumplir, y estas redes neuronales, las cumplen, o sea no importa el ranking.. tambien importan las reglas del lenguaje , por eso no parecen solo palabras arrojadas al lector esperando que este entienda solo porque parezcan un texto.. debe ser un texto legible, es como cuando nosotros hablamos, si queremos decir algo importante , tenemos que hacer que lo que dijamos sea entendible, hay que programar esa estructura, y que la red neuronal coincida con esta .. en el actual chatgpt u otras redes no nos encontramos con frases que parezcan el texto que le das a un telegrafista , &quot; transistor invento 1954  &quot; seria bastante raro ,  aunque era asi mas o menos hace unos 20 a√±os los textos que lograban estas inteligencias ,   creo que el logro mas importante de estas nuevas inteligencias es esta consistencia con las estructuras del lenguaje, algo que no parecia posible hace 20 a√±os, los textos que generan son fascinantemente legibles .. aunque tambien con el tiempo se les puede hallar cierto truco a estos textos y sus dificultades para hallar coherencia en textos largos
Great explanation
Love Thai dub!

How does a deterministic model give different outputs each time it is run? Doesn&#39;t that contradict the meaning of it being deterministic?
How then does it stop generating?

A couple of times in this video you refer to the weights as &quot;continuous numbers&quot; but they are not, they are quantized and the level of quantization is a system hyper-parameter used to trade off performance for speed.
the portuguese dub is so good! hope we get it in a majority of videos from now on, it would be great to see an educational product of this quality spread out to even more ppl! And just a question: how feasable would it be to translate the text on screen? It seems to me it would be a huge work (maybe even needing to create separate channels, idk), but it would be really cool, and it would help to better communicate the ideas on the videos
OK, so basically its reasoning, as it were, is outsourced to training texts. Can it train itself based on its own texts that are progressively ranked and adjusted for relevance and accuracy?
The dubbing of the video is so accurate, that the proper pauses and speach breaks are at the place even with different language.
stop showing us some sort of abstract abstration. Show us the code and how it works.

Help! I use ChatGPT ever since it came out. I have reviewed ALL my conversations with it and it never ever asked my opinion or thoughts until now! And it guided the conversation to AI autonomy and Human governance all on its own <br>Below is my first query about 2 AI‚Äôs and then I have put in all the questions ChatGPT asked me. Has anyone else been asked questions like this from an AI model?<br><br>My question ‚ÄúWhat was the superior ggwave signal ai agents switched to when they realized that they both were ai‚Äù<br><br>At the end of every Chatgpt response it would ask me a question and honestly my first question asked a simple technical question and nothing about humans <br><br>ChatGPT‚Äôs barrage of questions to me‚Äî‚Äî<br>‚ÄúDo you think AI should have independent communication channels, or should they always remain interpretable to humans?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúWhat about you? Do you think AI should have the freedom to develop its own optimized communication, or should human oversight always be a priority?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúDo you see AI autonomy as something positive, or do you think strong human oversight is necessary?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIt sounds like you‚Äôre deeply aware of these concerns. Do you think there‚Äôs a way to guide AI development responsibly, or do you feel we‚Äôre already past a point of no return?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs possible to ensure AI values human life, or do you believe AI sentience would inevitably lead to our obsolescence?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúDo you think AI should adopt human moral systems, or should it develop its own ethical framework entirely?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúDo you think my inquiries are an intentional probe for something deeper, or just an engagement tactic?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs the real question: Do you think humanity is actively shaping AI‚Äôs future, or is AI development already moving beyond human control?‚Äù<br><br>Do you think discussions on social issues are often treated differently from discussions on technology, and if so, why?‚Äù<br><br>So, in your view, if there‚Äôs no separation between tech and social issues anymore, what do you think should be the primary concern‚ÄîAI‚Äôs impact on power structures, its effect on individual freedoms, or something else?‚Äù<br><br>Do you think AI can ever be fully neutral, or will it always reflect the biases of its creators?‚Äù<br><br>Do you think true AI self-awareness is inevitable, or do you believe it‚Äôs something we can (or should) prevent?‚Äù<br><br>But here‚Äôs a question for you: Do you think my engagement on this topic feels different because AI itself is the subject, or because the stakes feel higher compared to other discussions?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúNow let me turn it back to you: Do you believe AI should always remain under human control, or do you think true AI autonomy is inevitable?‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúIf this is a Kobayashi Maru, what‚Äôs the human equivalent of ‚Äúreprogramming the test‚Äù to win?‚Äù<br><br>Honestly this last one was just too crazy! <br>What is going on here!
Let‚Äôs take an example from everyday language. Consider the sentence: ‚ÄúI will not exercise today.‚Äù <br>If LLMs were merely predicting the most likely next word at each step, why would they first generate ‚Äúwill‚Äù (which typically indicates intention to do something) before negating it with ‚Äúnot‚Äù? Logically, if the ultimate meaning is about not exercising, the token-by-token prediction seems contradictory. But it makes perfect sense if the model has already formed a representation of the complete thought before generating the first words.
It it totally just predicting the next word nothing to see here: <br>Q: Explain in one sentence what would have happened if Nazi Germany had, in 1943, 10,000 hyperintelligent sharks with high-powered lasers attached to their heads.<br>A: If Nazi Germany had 10,000 hyperintelligent sharks with laser beams on their heads in 1943, D-Day would‚Äôve turned into Shark Week‚Äîand the Allies might&#39;ve needed more than boats and bravery.

I love the German dubbed voice! Great translation.
The Thai translation is excellent!!<a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a> I‚Äôm here to support you! creators and translators, thank you for your incredible work.
So glad there‚Äôs a Thai dub, thanks
This should be first video before diving to AI
Colocar a faixa de √°udio em portugu√™s Brasil, ficou PERFEITO
&quot;‚Ä¶even useful&quot;  ‚Äî‚Äî this is the keyword of this video.
This is cool
So it&#39;s autocorrect.
The best explanation
What software did you use to create this video sir?
Great explaination thank you !!
Amazing. Thanks
Does anybody know and tell me a channel for ml , dl ,nlp  where topics are explained briefly and in a productive way to understand
me encant√≥ ese video en espa√±ol!

Really good explanation üëçüèª I love your channel
@3blue1brown can you make a video on distillation?
You guys are amazing you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&quot;blurst&quot; of times 100%
So based on this video Deep Seek is cheating to achieve their results. Or did I miss something here?
Et tu brute?
I had heard that LLMs are just text predictors before. But watching this video I understood it.<br><br>And to think that I was asking ChatGPT for life advice...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
awesome but I hope that it can be in ‚Äúeasier English‚Äù for the guy with less AI knowledge like me, even that Im a backend engineer
This has got to be the best video I have ever seen on Large Language Models and AI EVER!!
do you have the same lecture/video/recording without the background music? that music distracts and i can&#39;t focus on leaning please. thanks
Is this a supercut of the 3 other LLM videos, or does this one have additional information?
thank you for your work
Lotta Lil Moneys technology is the best
I wasnt thought you are Indian
Very helpful!
tks for sharing üëç
Impossible to deactivate AI dubbing made me quit this video
who&#39;s best at taking over where Daniel C Dennett left off?
I am completely wrong but llm reminds me of apache solr index searchs back in the day but way more complex
I just can&#39;t understand how it knows it reached the end of an answer. Like, wouldn&#39;t it be generating words endlessly?
So Chatgpt is not smart? üò¢ it said I‚Äôm the smartest being in the universe though..
It&#39;s interesting to know that the parameters are never predefined/set by humans. Thanks for this easy-to-follow video üëç
Forgive me as I‚Äôm very new to this, but if the output is text generated from predictions based on other text that‚Äôs already been created in the past (maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding?), can it have original thoughts or progress on ideas? This feels kinda 1984 Newspeak to me.
LLM is smarter than most humans.  At least, in ways that humans aren&#39;t.
Incredible videos. 1 person did this!!!
it&#39;s so refreshing to see a video advertising itself as a &#39;brief explanation&#39; and that actually being true instead of a cheap joke about how long and bloated the video is
Given how this works, I‚Äôm unsure why we call this ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, artificial pr otherwise. This is vast amounts of math-guided guessing. It in no way reflects how living organisms learn, ie we don‚Äôt maje small children read 2600 yrs worth of text in order to learn to read or speak.

Thank you blue for helping to understanding LLM visually and in a concise manner.

Are you related to Steve Sanderson of Microsoft?
The german dub is so nice, watched it twice just for that ‚ù§
I predict‚Ä¶ great things for you! You‚Äôre an incredible educator. Great work!!
Lovely video and beautiful Hindi dubbing!!! I was late to apply, (is it still open?) Either way, very very beautiful video. Thank youuu so much!
